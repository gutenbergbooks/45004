<h3><a name="I" id="I"></a>I<br /><br />
<small>INTRODUCTORY</small></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">What</span> a pretty copper box, John. Where
did you get it?"</p>

<p>"I made it."</p>

<p>"You made it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, out of sheet copper in my room last night.
That's the way I spend my evenings. And such
fun as it is! I enjoy every minute of the time.
Mother says I'd work all night if she didn't stop
me.</p>

<p>"I'd like to do something like that. Do you
think I could learn to do it?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure you could. Do you know the blacksmith
around the corner? He taught me how to
do this work, and ever so much more. He got me
the tools, too. He says every boy can learn to work
with metals, so I thought I'd try it. I'll take you
around to see him sometime. Come up to my room
and I'll show my workshop and all the tools I use."</p>

<p>"It would be mighty nice to know how to do
something else besides running an elevator all day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
I get so tired of that. How long would it take me
to make a box like this one?"</p>

<p>"Not very long if you begin in the right way. I've
worked at it only since I left school. The manual
training I got there helped me to know how to handle
the tools. You had that training, too, and I know it
will help you. Here we are, this is my workshop and
bedroom. Let's work here together and I'll teach you
all I know: how to use the tools and just what to do."</p>

<p>So began two boys to do work that one had done&mdash;metal
work which any boy can do if he will but
take the trouble to get the tools and have the
patience to learn the way step by step.</p>

<p>"You don't need a large room for your workshop,
you see," said John. "The table here is my work
bench and all the tools can be put into a box out
of the way when you are not using them.</p>

<p>"Here are my sketches of the tools one needs
to make almost anything out of copper, brass, or
silver. The blacksmith made the drawings for me
and taught me how to make some of the tools myself.
He says every boy should learn to make his
own tools and I shan't be satisfied until I can make
them all. Then I can make them as I need them
and only those that fit the work best. But I had
to buy most of them to start with. Here they are."</p>

<h3><a name="II" id="II"></a>II<br /><br /><small>
TOOLS</small></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">These</span> are my shears. They are sometimes
called jewellers' snips. I use them for
cutting copper, wire, and my designs. You
can buy them at any hardware store. But be sure to
get a good pair, as they are needed for so many
things.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_017.jpg" width="600" height="429" alt="Tools" />
</div>

<p>I do all my measuring with a steel square.
You see it takes the place of a two-foot
rule. It's useful for squaring
up, too. See, it has the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>,
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, and 1-in. spaces.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_018.jpg" width="350" height="150" alt="Pliers" />
<div class="caption"> </div>
</div>

<p>My dividers are my compasses.
I draw circles, mark pieces, and
find centres with
them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
The pliers are used to twist the binding
wire and to hold the metal when it is to be
heated, or soldered,
etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_018a.jpg" width="500" height="157" alt="Wooden block" />
</div>

<p>You can get a wooden
block like this anywhere.
Hard wood is best. This block is 6 &times; 4 &times; 4 ins.
You see, I cut out a hollow bowl-shaped
place in the top. When I want to work a flat
piece of copper into a rough bowl shape, I hammer
it into the depression.
The opposite end of
the block, which is flat,
is useful in many ways,
too.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_018b.jpg" width="350" height="374" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Bench vise</div>
</div>

<p>I couldn't get along
without my bench vise.
Here it is; made of metal. It can
be fastened to a table as well as to
a bench. It holds any tool used
for shaping and also the metal
when I wish to file it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_019.jpg" width="500" height="93" alt="Punch" />
</div>

<p>This piece of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. hexagonal steel, 5 in. long,
tapered at one end down to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in., is a punch for
making or pressing holes in copper or silver. The
size of the hole depends upon the length you drive
the punch into the metal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_019a.jpg" width="500" height="81" alt="Centre punch" />
</div>

<p>The centre-punch is made like this one, but the end
is ground to a point.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_019b.jpg" width="400" height="217" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Raising hammer</div>
</div>

<p>Here are my hammers. I have three and a
wooden mallet. The raising hammer is used for
many things which you will learn as you get on.
You see one end is
somewhat rounded.
You can pound
away on the copper
with this hammer
and have no
fear of driving holes into the metal. It's the
first hammer I use to shape up the metal bowl
with.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_020.jpg" width="400" height="327" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Shaping hammer</div>
</div>

<p>The shaping or driving hammer is flat at one end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and rounded at the other. Its bent head is shaped
so that you can use it in places where a straight
headed hammer won't go. It's the only
hammer to use when you work on the outside
of boxes or bowls to shape them up.</p>

<p>Sometimes
lumps are left
on the surface
of the copper
after the raising
hammer has been used. These
are smoothed away with the planishing
hammer. Its broad end flattens these rough
places and makes the surface perfectly level

<img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="300" height="281" alt="Fire screen" />
</div>

<p>Here is a little fire screen
I made myself. You need
one, you know, to put your
metal in, at times, for
annealing and soldering.
It's a safe way to prevent
the blaze burning the table
or setting fire to anything.
I take two pieces of board, each 6 &times; 12 &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> ins.
(any kind of lumber will do). Nail the two 12-in.
edges of the boards together, at right angles to
each other. Nail this to a base and line the whole
inside with asbestos. You can place any piece of
metal you wish to heat in this corner and direct a
flame upon it with perfect safety.</p>

<p>All the heat I need comes from a gas burner.
Here I have a bunsen burner, and for such work
as I do on rings, scarf pins, hat pins, etc., or for any
work that doesn't need lots of heating in the process,
the bunsen burner will do. But for annealing,
which you have to do when you make bowls, or for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
soldering, when you make boxes, you must have a
stronger flame. Then I use the gas range in the
kitchen or the bellows blower and blow pipe. If
you happen to be where you can't get a gas flame,
an alcohol lamp with a mouth blow pipe can be used.</p>

choose from: bowls, boxes, trays, etc. If a boy
can make all these models he can go on
and make nearly anything in copper, or even
silver, he would like to make. Here are the
bowl designs I have drawn. Of course there are
bowls of different shapes, and some have covers
to them. But we will try to get the
shape that's most pleasing. Let's take this
wrapping paper and draw a number of shapes
on it, keeping the diameter and depth of each
bowl the same. This model is 4 ins. in diameter and
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. deep. Let's make all our drawings of

<p>"Now that we've decided on the size and shape
of the bowl, I must tell you something about the
copper to be used. All sheet copper is sold by number,
the higher the number the thinner the metal.
Number 20 is a good size to use for most bowls
and boxes. I use size 20 for mine. If you
want a bowl to be lighter, use size 22 or 24.

HOW TO MAKE A COPPER BOWL</small></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Here</span> are the tools and the material that we
need to make our first piece of work:</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> 1 Sheet of copper, 20 gauge.
Powdered pumice stone.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Hard wood block, dividers, shears, round
headed hammer, planishing hammer, round top
stake, mallet, files.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_034.jpg" width="300" height="262" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Wood block</div>
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Take the sheet of copper, and with
the dividers mark on the copper a circle having a
diameter a little longer than the contour of your
bowl design. Cut this circle out with your
shears.</p>

<p>With the round headed hammer, using the rounded
end, beat the metal disc into the hollow of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
wooden block until it takes on a fairly even bowl
shape. Keep turning the metal with the left hand
while you hammer it with the right.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_034a.jpg" width="300" height="285" alt="" />
<div class="caption">The long even buckles are easily
hammered out; the short, sharp ones
are the kind that cause the cracks</div>
</div>

<p>You soon have a
rough shaped bowl
full of bumps and
wrinkles around the
outer edge.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_034b.jpg" width="300" height="217" alt="Shaping the bowl" />
</div>

<p>These wrinkles
must come because
the circumference of
the metal disc decreases
as it takes on the bowl shape. So long as
these wrinkles are long regular curves, they will
work out all right. If
they should take short,
sharp shapes there is danger
of the metal splitting.
In order to avoid this be sure to keep the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
wrinkles hammered out flat as you work
along.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_035.jpg" width="500" height="549" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Smoothing surface of bowl
 with the planishing hammer</div>
</div>

<p>If you went on hammering too long after your
bowl is shaped, the bowl would crack or perhaps
break, for hammering leaves copper hard and
springy. So you must soften it before you can
safely hammer any more. To do this I hold the
bowl over a gas range until it is red all over, then
I plunge it into cold water. This heating to soften
up the copper is called annealing. Repeat the hammering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
until the bowl takes on the shape of the
design.</p>

<img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="500" height="506" alt="" />
<div class="caption">In this way one can get
the shape desired</div>
</div>

<p>Now take your round top stake and put it into
the vise. Place the bowl over the round top stake,
and with the planishing hammer, beat the surface
until it is perfectly smooth, driving the metal just
hard enough to flatten the bumps made by the
hammering in the wooden block. If carefully
done the surface will be true and bright and covered
over with brilliant facets. A skillful hammer-man
can really drive the metal in any direction he may
wish. In this way you make a bowl out of one
piece of copper. The top of the bowl will be
ragged. Cut this rough edge with a pair of shears.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
File the top with a smooth file until it is perfectly
true. A good test to make sure of this is to lay the
bowl down on a plate of glass, or hold it up against
the window pane. If there are still any tiny openings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
left in the edge the light will be easily seen
through them. More filing must be done until no
light comes through from the smallest space. This
done, take a piece of emery cloth and rub the edge
of the bowl until the file marks disappear. If you
lap the cloth over the edge your rubbing will leave
a rounded edge, which is just the finish it should
have.</p>

<img src="images/i_038.jpg" width="250" height="197" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Marking the edge of the bowl</div>
</div>

<p><i>To flatten the bottom of a bowl:</i> Turn the bowl
upside down on a bench.
With a pair of dividers find
the centre of the bottom of
the bowl. This is done by
placing one leg of the dividers
against the side of the
bowl and with the other making a light scratch as
near the centre as you can. Change the position
of the dividers to the opposite side and do the
same, but be careful that the scratch is light.
Repeat this until you have done it on the four sides.</p>

<p>Where these lines cross is the centre. With one
leg of the dividers on the centre draw a circle having
a diameter of about two inches. Take a wooden
mallet and strike down on the centre of the circle.
This will flatten the bottom. Work from both sides
of the circle and keep the rounding edge just touching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the circle made by the dividers. If the strokes
are too heavy the bottom will bend in like the
dotted lines in the sketch.</p>

<div class="caption">Flatten the bottom</div>
</div>

<p>In that case, turn the bowl
up and hammer from the inside.
The bowl is now ready
for polishing. Mix some
powdered pumice stone with
water. With a woollen cloth
that has been wet and then dipped into the mixture,
rub the bowl. This both cleans and polishes and
at the same time gives a beautiful lustre to the
surface of the metal.</p>

sheet of plain paper. Draw
on it a 3-in. circle. Using
the same centre, draw a 5-in.
circle. This gives you the
plan or top view of the tray.
Below this view on the same
sheet, draw the elevation, or
edge view of the tray. You
can make the tray as deep
in the centre as you wish. Let's make this one
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. deep, that's a good proportion.</p>

<p>This is what we call
a working drawing.
If you are pleased with
the design, you can
go right on with the work, if not, you can
change it to suit. You can see by the design
that the tray is made by driving the centre
of this square plate of copper down into a depression.
In order to do this we must make a mould
the exact size and shape of the tray centre. This
is what the square hard wood block is used for.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>

</div>

<p>Take your hard wood block. Draw diagonal lines
across one face. Where these lines intersect is the
centre. With your dividers,
using this centre, draw a 3-in.
circle. Place the carpenters'
chisel anywhere on the
circle and strike with a hammer,
driving the chisel down
into the wood about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. Do this all around the
circle. Gouge out the loose wood until you have
cleaned out the whole depression, being careful
not to go below <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. in depth (the depth of
your design). Smooth this up nicely with sand-paper.
The mould is now ready for the metal
plate. With the steel punch, make holes in
each corner of the copper plate about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. from
the edge and just large enough to fit the wire
nails. Place this plate over the mould so that the
centre of the plate comes right over the centre of
the mould. Fasten the four
corners down with the wire
nails. To drive the metal into
the depression we must use
something softer than a steel hammer. A hard
wood peg has been found to do this best. Cut a
piece about 6 in. long from the end of a broom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
handle. Round one end up, using a file or a carpenters'
chisel to do so.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="250" height="328" alt="Using peg" />
</div>

<p>Place the rounded end of the peg on the circle
of the copper plate and,
with a hammer, drive the
copper into the depression
below it. As constant hammering
hardens copper so
that it ceases to respond
to the blows, it is necessary
to soften up the metal
by annealing as the work
goes on. Take the sheet
off the block. To do this, place the point of the
chisel under the copper sheet close to the nail
head and pry the nails out, lifting both copper and
nail up at the same time.</p>

<p>After annealing, nail the copper plate in the same
place as before. With the wooden peg continue
driving until you fill the depression, at the same time
flattening all parts of the metal that may push up.
Be careful not to mar the copper at any time.
When everything is perfectly flat and smooth take
it off as before.</p>

<p>We are now ready to draw the 5-in. circle on the
copper. The centre for this circle is the centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of the depression; and that is found with the dividers
in the same way as you found the centre for
the bottom of the bowl. Make the circle on the
copper. With the shears cut along a little on the
outside of this line. Smooth up and round the
edges of the tray with a mill file. Rub out file
marks with a little piece of emery cloth. If the
hammering has been uneven some parts of the copper
will have stretched more than other parts and the
tray will not lie flat when placed on a table. To
level this up, place the tray top side down upon a
bench or table and strike gently with a mallet on
the surface. Holding the mallet near the head one
can control the blows and be able to strike gently.
But if it is held toward the end of the handle the
blows will not be uniform. This applies to all
hammers, whether of wood or steel. You will
notice as you do your hammering the high spots
will settle down and gradually flatten. The tray
is now ready for cleaning and polishing. This is
done in the same way as you treated the bowl.</p>

<p><i>Decoration:</i> Round trays may be decorated in
many simple ways by drilling holes in the rim, and
then sawing out designs to suit one's fancy, or they
may be notched at intervals. Nothing is more decorative
though, than the embossed or repouss&eacute; design,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
made by beating from the back and raising the metal
on the face above the level. One of the designs
given here shows the embossed, and the other shows
a combination of the embossed and sawed out work.</p>

<p><i>The value of the mould:</i> It may seem to you like
a lot of work to make a mould just for this round
tray, but it can be used many times for making this
kind of tray and also for trays of similar shape,
like bowl covers, etc. Most of the jewellery nowadays
is made in moulds, wood, steel, or lead. Copper,
silver, and gold medals, pins, rings, tea and dinner
sets are all made by the mould or die method.
This mould you have just made is only a simple
one; however, complex ones are made in the same
way. The skill all lies in making a very good design
first and then in making a very smooth mould
to fit the design. After one or two trials it comes
easy enough. The chapter at the end of the book
will explain die and mould making in modern copper,
silver, and goldsmith shops.</p>


<h4>SQUARE TRAY</h4>

6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. Draw this size oblong on a sheet of
paper. The rim of the tray should be <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. wide.
Draw an inner line all around, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. from the outside.
Below this draw your elevation, or edge
view, showing the depth of the tray. In this design
it is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. deep.</p>

one leg against the edge of the copper, draw all
around the four sides, marking the lines on the
metal. You now have a flat sheet marked ready for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
bending. Place the sheet of copper between the vise
jaws, the inner line even and on a line with the vise.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="500" height="354" alt="Shaping tray" />
</div>

<p>The hard wood peg should be cut to a flat tapered
end. This flat end of the peg is held at an angle
of about 45&deg; against the copper plate, just above
the vise jaw and against the line of the rectangle.
With the mallet drive gently. By doing this the
body of the tray is pushed in, but the rim is kept
straight in the vise. Repeat this all around. You'll
have a tray like the sketch. If the body of the tray
is not deep enough put it into the vise again and keep
driving it until you get the depth you want. The
inner corners will be found to be rounded, as they
should be. Round off the outside corners to match.
File the edges round and finish with an emery cloth,
clean and polish as explained before.</p>

PAPER CUTTER AND NUT SET</small></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Let's</span> make a paper cutter like this sketch.
We can draw the design on paper first
and then cut it out. Here is what we
need to make it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="600" height="105" alt="" />
</div>

<h4>PAPER CUTTER</h4>

<p><i>Material:</i> Heavy copper, No. 8 gauge, 10 inches
long by 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches wide.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Drill press and drills, jewellers' saw
frame, cold chisel, files, vise, emery cloth, few wire
nails (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in.) two blocks of hard wood, one, 10 &times;
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins., and the other, 6 &times; 2 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_049.jpg" width="500" height="288" alt="Cutting out knife" />
</div>

<p>Cut out the design and paste it on the copper
plate. If our shears could cut copper as heavy
as this we would have little trouble to cut our
design out. But the shears can't do this work,
so we have to put the copper into the vise and cut
the design out with a cold chisel and hammer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Place the copper into the vise with the line of design
to be cut flush with the top of the vise. With
hammer and chisel, cut along this line. The
back part of the vise will act as a shear and
help in the cutting and will prevent the copper
breaking away and leaving the edge rough. When
this is done, place the paper knife in the vise and
file all the edges smooth. Now that it's cut out
and smoothed up we are ready to saw out the
design in the handle. To do this drill holes in the
design as a starting point for the sawing. Take the
drill press and put a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. drill into the chuck.
Drill a hole in any part of the design. Take the
jewellers' saw frame and fasten one end of the small
saw into one of the legs of the frame; push the loose
end through the hole made by the drill. Fasten
the loose end to the other leg of the saw frame so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the saw is fairly tight. In order to saw properly,
we must have something to support the piece while
we are working on it. This is best done by taking
a block of wood 6 &times; 2 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. and cutting out a V-shaped
notch in one end. Place this in the vise, or
nail one end of it to a bench so that the V-shaped
end will extend over the bench or vise to be free
to work upon. Put the handle to be sawed out
on this block so that it will be supported on
both sides of the parts to be
sawed out (see sketch of work
in vise). The saw will play
freely up and down in the
notch. All sawed work is done in the same way.</p>

<p><i>To file the edges sharp:</i> Take your hard wood
block, 10 &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins.; fasten the cutter down
tight by driving two short wire nails half their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
length into the wood at each end of the cutter.
Place the cutter between these nails, bend the ends
over, and fasten down (see sketch). Place all into
the vise jaw and tighten it up. With a rough flat
file, file the edges down, working from the centre
line both ways. When one side is filed about half
the thickness of the copper, bend the nails, take off
the cutter. Reverse it, put it back, and file as before.
Do this until the edges become sharp.</p>

<img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="600" height="98" alt="" />
<div class="caption">File the edges sharp</div>
</div>

<p>To finish this piece of work as it should be done,
we must do some draw filing. The draw filing is
done in this way: Take hold of both ends of the
flat file, the handle in one hand and the end of the
file in the other. Stand lengthwise of the piece.
Place the file flat down on the blade with the teeth
of the file pointing in the same direction as the
blade. Push it from you and pull it toward you,
at the same time pressing down on the blade. This
is draw filing and it is the only way to make a piece
of metal true, and free from the marks of the cross
filing which was done in the beginning. Repeat
this on the other side until the whole paper cutter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
including the handle is smooth. Wrap a piece of
emery cloth around a block and rub all over the
surface. Polish and finish as before described.</p>


<h4>NUT SET: BOWL, PLATES, AND SPOON</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_052.jpg" width="250" height="153" alt="Bowl" />
</div>

<p>A very beautiful nut set consisting of a bowl, four
plates, and a nut spoon or a
shovel, can be made out of
copper. One uses the same
tools to make this set as
were used for the copper
bowl, and the work of making it is done in much
the same way.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> 9-in. disc of No. 20 copper (bowl).
Four 5-in. discs (for plates). Piece of copper 2 &times; 3
ins. (No. 8).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_052a.jpg" width="300" height="212" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Flat-iron</div>
</div>

<p>Take the 9-in. disc and hammer it into the desired
bowl shape, on the
hard wood block.
The plate should be
hammered up in the
same way, keeping
the depression in
the centre of the
plates about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in.
deep. A very beautiful finish can be made on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
these bowls and plates by the use of the round
end of the raising hammer and a flat-iron. Place
the handle of the iron between your knees, face
up. Put the bowl or plate, face up on the flat-iron
and go over every part with the rounded end
of the hammer. This produces a surface covered
with oval facets, giving a mottled effect. The
edges of the bowl and plates may be left
straight or they may be rounded, according to the
design.</p>


<h4>NUT SPOON</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_053.jpg" width="600" height="188" alt="Nut spoon" />
</div>

<p>Draw the design on paper. Cut the design out
and paste it on the copper. This piece of No. 8
copper is too heavy to be cut with the shears, so
it must be placed in the vise. See that the outline
is even with the top of the vise jaws. With the
cold chisel and hammer cut along the top of the vise
as you did when making the paper knife. Now you
have a shovel-shaped metal of the same thickness
all over. Where the handle joins the bowl the metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
should be left thicker than in any other place,
otherwise the spoon will bend in the using. To
thin out the metal of the bowl, hammer it. Begin
where the handle joins the bowl and thin out
to the edge. The handle is shaped by working
from the bowl out toward the handle end,
constantly widening and flattening it. Cut off
the surplus metal, keeping to the original design.
The handle may be left plain or some simple
sawed out design may be put on. File up, rounding
the edges off so that the spoon feels smooth and is
comfortable to handle. Place the whole on a hard
wood block and beat the bowl and handle into
shape. Many nut spoons have designs sawed out
in the bowl to lighten the weight.</p>

HARD AND SOFT SOLDERING</small></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Soldering</span> is a process of joining two metals
together. It is not hard to learn to do. If you
are careful when you do the work to have the
materials to be used perfectly clean, you may be sure
of success, for, after all, it's one of the easiest and
simplest of all the operations done with metals.</p>


<h4>HARD SOLDERING</h4>

<p><i>Material:</i> 1. Borax: bought in lumps, wrapped
in tin foil, or pulverized.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_055.jpg" width="350" height="155" alt="Borax slate" />
</div>

<p>2. Borax slate: a square piece of slate with a
small depression in one side. Any piece of clean
slate will do. This is
used to grind the lump
borax, or to mix the
pulverized borax to a
pasty condition on.</p>

<p>3. Solder: silver solder, sometimes called hard
solder. It can be bought by the sheet in large or
small quantities. Bunsen burner, or either one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the following: blowpipe and foot bellows with gas
flame, a blacksmiths' fire with coke or charcoal.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> The parts of the metals to be joined
should, first of all, be scraped or filed bright. This
prepares them best for the solder. Take a lump of
borax, grind it up and mix with a little water, on
the slate, until it is like a paste. Take a sheet of silver
solder, cut a number of slits lengthwise down the
sheet and then cut them crosswise. You will
have a number of pieces about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. square. These
bits are dropped into the borax solution until
they are completely covered with the paste. With
a camels' hair brush, wash the edges of the metal
to be joined, with the solution of the borax. Tie
the pieces together with an iron binding wire,
taking care to have the edges to be joined close
together and in the proper position. If you don't,
the solder will not fill up all the openings and cracks,
and parts will be left unsoldered. Now, wash all
around the joint with the borax solution. Place
bits of solder at intervals along the joint, fairly
close. Warm the work gently in the flame. This
drives off the water in the borax solution. When the
borax is quite dry in the joint direct a stronger
flame over the whole work. Heat it gradually,
but be careful that no part of the metal, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
that around the joint, becomes red-hot, and that
both sides of the joint get red-hot at the same time.
If you don't guard this, the solder will climb to
the hotter side and leave the other, and the edges
will not unite. Cool it off in water and file the joint
perfectly smooth.</p>


<h4>SOFT SOLDERING</h4>

<p>For mending teakettles, tin cans, tin cups,
or anything made of tin, galvanized iron, or
lead.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> Lead solder, comes in small bars. Flux
(1.) Resin and sweet oil. (2.) Muriatic acid. (3.)
Tallow candle.</p>

<p><i>Tool:</i> Soldering iron (can be made out of a piece
of half-inch round copper.)</p>

<p><i>How to solder:</i> Soft solder is a mixture of tin and
lead in even proportions. This solder melts at a
very low temperature. That is why we can do the
work with the soldering iron. I find I can solder
many things at home with the soft solder, and I'm
going to tell you how I mended a leak in the teakettle
the other day. First, I took a pocket knife
and cleaned all around the hole or leak, scraping
the dirt off both inside and out. Then I mashed a
little resin up fine and mixed a little sweet oil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
with it. Then I washed inside and outside of
this leak with the mixture. After heating my
soldering iron in a stove (any kind of fire will
do) I took a bar of solder, held it over the
leak, and melted off a bit with the hot iron.
You can make the solder flow over the leak by
pressing the iron right on the hole. You see,
the heat of the iron melts the solder and at the
same time it heats the tin hot enough to make
the solder cling to it. Before the part got
cold I rubbed off the oil and resin with a
woollen cloth. This left the work nicely cleaned.
You can mend any leak in anything made of tin,
in this way.</p>

<p>Galvanized iron utensils are soldered in exactly
the same way, but you must use muriatic acid in
place of the resin and sweet oil. But if you wish
to solder anything made of lead or pewter a tallow
candle is rubbed over the place to be mended, instead
of resin and sweet oil or muriatic acid. In every
other way the work is just the same. But
lead, you know, melts at a very low temperature,
so you must be careful when working on it
that your soldering iron is just hot enough to
melt the solder and not hot enough to melt
the lead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
And now I am going to tell you how you can make
your own soldering iron out of copper.</p>


<h4>HOW TO MAKE A SMALL SOLDERING IRON</h4>

<p><i>Material:</i> A piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. round copper, 3 ins.
long, a piece of No. 8 wire, 18 ins. long, or a piece
of light telephone or telegraph wire will do. Some
soft solder. Resin and sweet oil. Small piece of
clean tin. Manufactured fluid for soldering (used
sometimes in place of muriatic acid).</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Punch, vise, file, hammer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="i_059"></a><img src="images/i_059.jpg" width="600" height="101" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Soldering iron</div>
</div>

<p>Place the end of the copper rod in the fire and
heat it red-hot. Take it out of the fire and punch
a hole about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. from the end of the rod, large
enough to allow the No. 8 wire to go through.
Push the wire through this hole until half is on one
side and half is on the other. Bend the wire close
up to the sides to form the handle. In order to
make this rigid, place the rod into the jaws of the
vise and pinch the wire into the copper rod. This
prevents any swinging motion. Take hold of both
ends of the wire with the pincers and twist them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
close to the copper rod. This makes a good handle.
Heat the copper end of the rod red-hot, and with
a hammer flatten it to a four-sided tapering end
about one inch long and ending in a blunt point.
(See <a href="#i_059">picture</a>.) Cool off in water and file the end
of soldering iron smooth.</p>

<p>Now it must be tinned. On your piece of tin
place some soft solder, oil, and resin. Heat the
soldering iron hot enough to melt the solder, rubbing
it up and down on the tin, mixing all together. Do
this on all four sides, and in a little while you'll
find the solder has covered the end of the soldering
iron. When this is done the iron is ready to be
used.</p>

CANDLESTICK, SCONCE, ROSE JAR, AND CHALICE</small></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span> are many forms of candle holders.
Perhaps the one we are all most familiar
with is the candlestick. Before the days
of lamps and electricity the candle was everywhere.
Many different designs of candlesticks have come
down to us. Some were large, some small, some
plain, while others were highly decorated. But however
much the designs vary, there are many points
that all have in common. There is the base, large
or small, and a cylindrical shaft which rises from
the centre of the base. This holds the candle. The
drip pan is fastened to this shaft close to the top.
It catches the wax as the candle melts. Handles
are sometimes soldered on, and sometimes the
candlestick is made without one. They are attached
to the rim or to the shaft.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Hard wood block,
raising hammer, smooth file,
dividers, saw, round wood
peg, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 6 ins.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Beat the copper disc into a saucer
shape, for the base. Take the sheet of copper
for the stem, fold it around the wooden peg till
the edges come together. Scrape and solder the
joint with silver solder.</p>

hammer, curve it slightly to make a drip pan.
With the dividers, describe a circle <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter
in the centre of the drip pan. Cut out this centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>

fingers over the round peg (place the peg in the vise
to do this) until you have the shape you wish (see
<a href="#i_063a">design</a>). The wide end of the handle should fit
down on the outside of the rounding part of the
base, and the other end against the stem under the
drip pan. Bore a hole in each end and rivet the
handle in place. If a round handle is desired, take
a strip of copper <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. wide and 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. long, shape
round with the fingers. Scrape and solder at the
joints, and then solder on the edge of the base.
Place and finish up each part as described. This
candle design can be greatly varied. It can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
made taller, shorter, with various kinds of handles,
or with no handle at all.</p>


<h4>DESIGNS FOR NIGHT CANDLE HOLDER</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_064.jpg" width="500" height="446" alt="Night candle holders" />
</div>

<p>This kind of candle holder, or night light, is made
to hold a short, thick candle about 2 ins. in diameter,
which will burn from 6 to 10 hours. A round base
supports the candle, and a shade with a handle
on the back is fastened to the base. It can be
adjusted so that the candle burns freely all night,
while the shade protects the eyes from the light.
Nothing is more convenient than one of these holders,
for summer homes or for camping.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> Brass, No. 24, 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 4 ins. for reflector.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> ins. for cylinder. 2-in. disc for base.
No. 20, 6 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. for handle.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Picture shows a small night candle
made of brass. Cut out a 2-in. disc. Bend the
6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. strip to fit it. Solder the two ends of
the ring and make it perfectly round. Be careful
when rounding it up not to stretch it larger than
the disc. Push disc into the ring flush with the
bottom. Solder the bottom into the ring. Draw
the outline of the reflector on the 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 4-in. piece
and cut away the corners. Bend it to fit the holder.
It should cover about one half of the circle. Solder
the reflector on. Soft solder is strong enough for
this work. Now bend the handle piece according
to the sketch. Rivet or solder it to the back of the
reflector. Polish and finish.</p>


<h4>NIGHT CANDLE HOLDER</h4>

<p>The ordinary tallow or wax candle is used in this
night candle holder. You will notice from the
sketch that the general style is much like that of the
small holder. However, in this design, a small cup
or stand to fit the candle is soldered on to the
base, a little toward the front.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> No. 24 brass&mdash;A 4-in. disc. 12 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
ins., for band to go around the disc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Reflector, 7 &times; 7 ins. Cup, <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins., and
handle piece, 6 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_066.jpg" width="500" height="440" alt="Reflectors" />
</div>

<p>The reflectors are sometimes left plain, though
the facets made by a flat placed hammer reflect the
light when the candles are lighted and soften the
light by day. The greater the reflecting power of
the surface, the better is the effect. If each part
is carefully filed and finished before they are all
put together there will be nothing but the polishing
needed.</p>


<h4>SCONCE (WITH ONE CANDLE)</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;">
<a id="i_067"></a><img src="images/i_067.jpg" width="363" height="600" alt="Sconce" />
</div>

<p>The sconce is a candle holder made to fasten upon
any wall. It is both useful and decorative. Some
are made to hold but one candle; they can be made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
however, for two, three, or four candles. All sconces
should have a reflector, a bowl, shaft, and drip
pan. But the designs vary to suit the individual
taste and surroundings. The design given here is
a very simple one and one that works out well in
copper or brass.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> One piece of No. 20 copper, 10 &times; 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
ins., for the reflector. One piece of No. 20, 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 1
in., for candle socket. One piece of No. 20 copper,
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. disc. One piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. round copper
4 ins. long.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Make a drawing like sketch shown
here. Place this drawing upon the 10 &times; 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in.
sheet of copper and cut the metal to fit the outline.
Mark on this sheet of metal the embossed line
shown in the sketch. Place the sheet of the copper
on the hard wood block and with a chasing tool
placed on the line, strike with the planishing hammer
on the end of the chasing tool. This, in turn, will
drive the metal into the wood. Repeat this till
the outline stands out above the face of the reflector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub> in. If this is done carefully the
raised part will be a true smooth line. The same
tool will widen the line any width desired. Cut
into a wood block a form like the impression you
see back of the candle. Place the sconce over
this impression and with a wooden peg drive the
metal into it. The dotted line on the sketch will
show how deep this should be. Drive out any
buckles that may have formed during the working
of the metal. This is done by placing the sconce
face down on the bench and striking down on the
raised parts until it lies flat.</p>

<p><i>Candle holder:</i> Bend the stock for the holder
around a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. mandrel or wood peg till the two
ends meet. Clean and solder these ends. Cut
a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. disc to fit the inside of this and solder in.
Place this on the 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. disc and drill a hole through
the centre of both.</p>

<p><i>Bracket for candle:</i> Take the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. round stock.
Put it in the vise with one end projecting above,
about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. Drive down on this end, at the same
time bend it as shown in the drawing. File the
end flat. Cut a piece of No. 20 copper <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>
in. and solder it on the end just filed. This plate
is drilled with two <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. holes, and filed around.
Bend the shape as shown in the drawing and on the
other end file a shoulder and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. pin. This is
now placed through the hole of the disc and the
candle holder, and both riveted to the bracket.
The bracket now is placed on the bottom of the
sconce (see <a href="#i_067">drawing</a>), and riveted on. The whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
sconce may now be nailed with round head nails
to a flat <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. board to give weight, or there may
be riveted to the back, angles made of No. 20 metal,
<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. wide and bent <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. one way and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. the
other way. These angle pieces are riveted on the
sides and on the two ends.</p>

<p>Rivets add much to the decoration of the work
if they are placed at intervals and properly spaced.
They make a nice finish. A hole can be drilled at
the top of the reflector, to hang it upon the wall.</p>


<h4>HOW TO MAKE A VASE, OR ROSE JAR (WITH LID)</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_070.jpg" width="150" height="169" alt="Vase" />
</div>

<p><i>Material:</i> One piece of copper, No. 20, 7 &times; 7 ins.
One piece 4 &times; 4 ins. (for lid). One
piece <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. wide and long enough to
go around the opening of the vase
or jar.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Round stake, anvil stake,
driving and planishing hammers, dividers, and shears.</p>

<p><i>Design:</i> Vase, having a base 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. in diameter,
height 3 ins., 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. opening at the top, and lid
to fit. The full height of the vase is 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins.</p>

<div class="caption">Third operation</div>
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Take the 7 &times; 7-in. piece of copper
and draw a 7-in. circle. With the dividers set
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in., using the same centre, describe a circle.
This outlines the 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. circle for the base. Drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
up this disc as you did the one for the copper bowl
on the wood block, making it as deep as possible.
In the same way as you flattened the bottom of the
copper bowl, flatten the bottom of this piece of
work. Place the bowl over the round head stake.
With your hammer drive on the
outside. This driving with the
hammer on the outside decreases
the diameter and increases the
length. You will remember that
the copper bowl was driven up
almost entirely by the use of the raising hammer on
the <i>inside</i> and finished by work on the outside with
the planishing hammer.
This vase or
jar calls for the
shaping hammer.
The vase is placed
over the round stake
and driven into
shape by work on
the <i>outside</i> with the
shaping hammer.
When the rough
bowl shape is on the
round head stake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
drive the sides straight, beginning the strokes at the
line of the base circle. Repeat till the sides begin to
straighten and take the shape of the design.
Take it off the round stake and place it on the
anvil stake.</p>

<p>When the sides are symmetrical, mark with lead-pencil
a line <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch from the top. Work
the copper above this line, over toward the centre,
until the opening of the vase is about 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. in
diameter. Smooth the work up with a planishing
hammer. If the hammer marks made by driving
the bowl into shape are carefully done
they leave a very beautiful mottled surface
of themselves.</p>

<p><i>To make the rim for the lid to rest upon:</i>
Take the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. strip of metal. Bend it into a
circle small enough to fit on the
opening left at the top of the vase.
Be careful to have this just to fit,
otherwise much filing will have to be
done, and in this position filing is
almost impossible. Cut it the right
length, scrape both ends, and solder.
Make it perfectly level so that it lies
flat when placed upon the bench. Test it by
placing it upon the top of the vase. File the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
flat, bind the rim in place. Wash, then place bits
of solder all around it and heat it until the solder
runs. Cool off in water, file off all rough edges left
by the solder, clean and polish.</p>

<img src="images/i_073.jpg" width="400" height="145" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Bending flange on the lid</div>
</div>

<p><i>Lid:</i> Take the 4 &times; 4-in. piece. Cut a 4-in. circle.
Place the bowl upside down upon this disc, draw
with a pencil all around the rim on this copper plate.
This marks the diameter of the rim on the plate,
also the line where the copper should be bent to
form the lid to fit the rim.</p>

<p>With the anvil stake in the vise, place the disc
against the sharp end of the stake, with the line
on the edge. Drive with the raising hammer against
the part projecting above the stake. Turn the disc,
keeping the circle line on the sharp edge of the stake.
Repeat this till the sides are at right angles to the
top. Place the lid upside down on a wooden block,
drive on the inside, shaping it like the drawing. Make
it fit the rim, trim off the rough edges, file up smooth,
and polish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Do not forget constant annealing, for you know
hammering always makes the metal hard.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> 3 pieces of copper, 6 &times; 6 ins., No. 20.
One piece of round rod copper, 1 in. long. One
piece of copper, 12 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. (for rim). Solder.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Hard wood block, round head and anvil
stakes, combination stake, shears, dividers, planishing
hammer, raising hammer, and shaping hammer,
files, emery cloth.</p>

<p><i>Parts:</i> Bowl, stem, base, lid, ornamental top of

<p><i>Bowl:</i> Take the 6 &times; 6-in. piece of copper. Cut out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
a 6-in. disc. Drive the bowl up as you did the copper
bowl. It should be the same shape as the copper
bowl. Do not flatten the bottom.
The drawing shows that
the bottom should be rounding,
to fit the stem.</p>

<img src="images/i_075.jpg" width="150" height="415" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Lid, Bowl and Stem</div>

<p><i>Stem and base:</i> Take another
piece of 6 &times; 6-in. copper.
Cut 6-in. disc. With the
dividers make a 1-in. circle in
the centre of the disc. This
inner circle must be beaten up
until it becomes the stem. To
do this place the disc on the round top stake,
with the marked circle touching the edge of the
round top. Strike with the raising hammer just
above the circle line, turning the disc each time.
When you have made one turn of
the disc, repeat this twice, hammering
just above the part
driven up before. Keep repeating
this until you have reached
within an inch and a half of the
outer edge of the disc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">

<p>The drawings numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, show the steps
in the working up of the copper disc into the stem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>

<img src="images/i_076a.jpg" width="600" height="169" alt="Shaping the stem" />
</div>

<p>You now have a bell-shaped piece. Anneal the
metal and repeat the hammering, beginning at the
same place and working up to the same place as
before. Anneal whenever the metal seems springy
and keep working until the stem is tapered about
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. at the small end, gradually widening into the
vase. Place the bell-like stem on the table and
flatten it so that it lies perfectly smooth, with the
stem perpendicular to the base. Find the centre of
the bowl, describe a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. circle. Scrape both the
circle and the small end of the stem. Turn the bowl
upside down, place the stem end of the base on the
bowl, and solder in the usual way.</p>

<p><i>To make the lid:</i> Take the 6 &times; 6-in. piece. Cut
a 6-in. disc. Find the centre. Drive the centre
down by using the small end of the planishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
hammer. This makes a cone-shaped centre, with
the sides gradually widening to the edge of the lid.
The highest point of the cone is one inch above the
level of the lid. Place the lid on the table and tap
gently on the outside until it lies flat. Take the
small <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. piece of round rod, file a small shaped
ornament (to taste) on one end of the rod and a
shoulder on the other end. Drill a hole in the cone-shaped
part of the lid, push the rod <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. through
this hole and rivet it on the inside.</p>

<p><i>Rim:</i> Strip of copper, 12 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. Bend it into
a circle just to fit the outside of the lid. Cut off
the proper length
and solder. Make
it perfectly round and perfectly
flat. Place the lid on the chalice
bowl so that it overlaps a little
all around, evenly. Draw a pencil
line all around the edge of the
bowl on the under side of the lid.
This is where the rim is to go.
Before soldering, test, by placing the rim on the
face of the lid. Any openings seen must be closed
by pressing the rim down to the lid. Bind
tightly with binding wire, scrape, and solder. File
and finish.</p>

HOW TO MAKE A HAT PIN</small></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">By this</span> time you will have many pieces of
scrap copper on hand. These should be
kept in a small box and used whenever
suitable.</p>

<img src="images/i_079.jpg" width="300" height="290" alt="Circle for head" />
</div>

<p><i>Material:</i> A piece No. 20 gauge, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins., is
enough to make the head of a
hat pin. The pin part must be
of steel, copper is too soft. Buy
any cheap hat pin in a dry goods
store. (A cent apiece.) Break
the glass top or black top and
use the pin for the copper head.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> One chasing tool, half
moon; shears, dividers, planishing
hammer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_079a.jpg" width="400" height="174" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Designs for hat pin heads</div>
</div>

<p><i>Design:</i> Hat pin with hexagonal
top (6 sides) 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins.
across. With your dividers draw
a circle on the piece of copper,
having a diameter of 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
With the radius of the circle, mark off the circumference
into 6 equal parts. Draw lead-pencil lines
from one point to another,
just touching the circle
at these points. With your
shears cut along these
straight lines. Now you
have a 6-sided piece of
copper 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. across.
Place this piece of copper
on the flat end of the hard wood block (the
grain end of the wood), and make impressions
on it with the half moon tool like your designs.
This tool you can make yourself. Take a
piece of steel, <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. square or round, heat
one end to a red heat and flatten it, like the
flat end of a chisel. File the end just flattened
blunt and rounding. This end should be hardened
to prevent it from wearing rough. To do this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
heat it to a dark red heat and plunge it into
cold water. Place your tool on the upper sides of
this plate and drive it with a hammer into the
copper, being careful not to drive it through
into the wood. If you drive the tool through you
will spoil the design and have rough edges. This
makes a simple raised
or embossed design and
is quite easily done.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="300" height="435" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Hat pin. Driving the design</div>
</div>

<p>When this pattern has been
stamped in, curve the piece
of copper any shape you wish
by placing it in the depression
in the hard wood block.
Place the embossed side down,
and with the round end of the
planishing hammer, drive with
light blows so as not to flatten
the design. In this way,
you can shape it as you wish.
The top could now be soldered
right on to the pin itself, but that would not make
a strong hat pin. It would be weak and too easily
broken from the head. In order to have a strong
hat pin we make a little mushroom shaped pin
holder which is fastened on the under part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>the head of the hat pin and in which the pin
itself fits.</p>

<h4>HOW TO MAKE THE PIN HOLDER</h4>

<p><i>Material:</i> Copper, No. 24, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. square to
make the flat disc. Copper No. 24, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. length
and about <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. wide to make the cylinder.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_083.jpg" width="150" height="268" alt="Pin holder" />
</div>

<p>With a pair of dividers draw a circle <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. in
diameter. Cut out the circle. Place this little
disc on the flat end of the hard wood block and with
a punch make a hole <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. in diameter in
the middle of the disc. On the same
end of the block, file (using round file)
a groove right across the corner, about
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. deep. Place the small piece of
copper (<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> ins.), over the groove.
Take the steel wire belonging to the
hat pin and place it on top of the copper and over
the groove. With the hammer, strike so as to drive
the pin, and at the same time the copper, into the
depression. The copper sinks into the groove and
the two sides lap up on each side of the pin.
Drive the two sides down until they lap around
the wire, the edges meeting. This makes a copper
cylinder which fits exactly around the wire of the
pin. Take the cylinder off, fit it into the holes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of the small disc. Wash the two pieces with a
borax solution, place a little solder on, and
solder the disc to the cylinder. After cooling the
piece in water, shape the disc so that it fits the
under side of the hat pin top. Polish the end of
the wire pin with an emery cloth, also the top
of the pin holder and the inside of the hat pin top.
Push the wire into the little cylinder so that it comes
flush with the disc.</p>

<div class="caption">Bending the cylinder</div>
</div>

<p>Now the pin is all ready to solder to the head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
but there is great difficulty in getting it in straight.
In order to do this I make a little device out of copper,
which helps me in getting things on straight. Take
a piece of copper 1 in. wide and 5 ins. long. Bend
each end, one 2 ins. and the other <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in., both in the
same direction at right angles. With the shears
cut a V-shaped piece in the short end. This little
stand is good for soldering any upright piece to a
flat piece, when
they should be at
right angles to
each other.</p>

<p>Place the top of
the pin on the long
leg of the stand
and, with the pin
in the slot, place
in proper position
and solder.</p>


<h4>HAT PIN HOLDER</h4>

<div class="caption">Holder</div>
</div>

<p>Here is a good design for a hat pin holder, a welcome
addition to any dresser. The design is very
simple and the holder is easily made if one follows
out the directions carefully.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> Disc 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. of No. 20 gauge, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
base. One piece of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. copper tubing, 4 ins.
long for the body. Solder.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Iron rod, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. round, 8 ins. long. Hard
wood block. Planishing hammer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_086.jpg" width="600" height="640" alt="Hat pin holder" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Bore a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. hole one inch deep in
the wooden block. Place the 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. disc over this
hole and, with the round end of the planishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
hammer, drive the centre of the disc into the hole
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. Be careful not to drive a hole through the
copper disc. Turn the piece upside down. Place the
iron rod in the vise. Put the bossed end of the disc
on the end of the iron rod and flatten the boss down.
Shape the base by rounding the edge down all
around. See that it
lies flat on the table,
without rocking.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_087.jpg" width="300" height="203" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Shaping base for stem</div>
</div>

<p><i>Stem:</i> All copper
tubing should be annealed
before any work
is done on it. After
annealing, place the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. rod through the hole of
the tube and with the wooden mallet drive down on
the tubing, beginning two inches from the end and
using the hard wood block for an anvil. This constant
driving and turning reduces the copper to any size required.
We must make the end of this tubing fit
the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. rod. The tube must widen toward the
other end, which is beaten out. Place it on the
small end of the anvil stake. Drive with the raising
hammer, turning it all the time. In this way you
constantly increase the diameter, making the cup-shaped
top like the design. Now the stem and
base are ready for soldering. File the ends perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
smooth and level. Bind in places and solder,
as before. The filing, finishing, and polishing must
be done as with other copper pieces.</p>

<p>Hat pin holders are usually filled with some soft
material. The hat pins are pushed down into this,
which helps to keep them in place. Some are covered
on the top with a metal disc which has five or
six holes bored through, a little larger than the bar
of the hat pin. These holes are drilled into the disc
and then the disc is soldered on to the top of the
holder. The pins cannot fall out with such an
arrangement, and they are not likely to gather
on one side and tip the holder over.</p>

HOW TO RIVET</small></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Riveting</span> is one of the processes of joining
two pieces of metal together without the
use of solder. To rivet, you must first punch
or bore holes into the metals along the edges to be
joined. Place a rivet through these holes, and
either with the hand hammer or rivet set, flatten
down the projecting end of the rivet, forming a head
similar to the head of the rivet itself. Be careful
to have the rivet holes just
large enough to let the rivet
slip in and leave no extra
space. If the holes are too
large the rivet will bend instead
of flattening.</p>

<img src="images/i_089.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Punching metal</div>
</div>

<p><i>Use of the rivet set:</i> A rivet
set is a piece of steel 5 ins.
long, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. wide and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.
thick, tapering a little toward the top end. In the large
end of this tool, and to one side, is a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. hole drilled
about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. deep; on the other side is a counter-sunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
hole about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. deep.
This hole is used for drawing the rivet up through
and closing the openings between the parts to be
riveted, previous to flattening the end. (See <a href="#i_090">picture
of stove pipe</a>.) The
counter-sunk hole is
made to shape the
head after it is flattened. Tinners use it often for
punching holes in thin metal, such as tin and
galvanized iron, and it's one of the
methods used for punching holes
when making or mending stove pipes,
and similar shaped pieces.</p>

<div class="caption">Rivet set. Punching holes in a stove pipe and riveting</div>
</div>

<p><i>To rivet a stove pipe:</i> Place the
rivet on the stake and put the iron
pipe over the rivet about where the hole should be.
Tip the pipe so it will rest on the rivet. Tap
lightly over the rivet. This will mark the spot
where the rivet is to go. Drive down the rivet set
over this mark and the rivet will be forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
through the pipes into the hole of the rivet set.
The hole is made and the rivet placed at the
same time. Flatten the projecting end, put the
counter-sunk hole on the top of this flattened end,
and you can shape it up like a round button.</p>


<h4>LARGE SERVING TRAY WITH RIVETED HANDLES</h4>

<p>A tray as large as this one is most useful in the
home for serving tea, ice cream, etc.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_091.jpg" width="400" height="324" alt="Square tray" />
</div>

<p><i>Material:</i> No. 20 copper, 12 &times; 18 ins. Four pieces
of copper, 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 2
ins. Silver wire for
rivets 4 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. in
diameter.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Perhaps
the easiest
and simplest way
to make this tray
is to get a large
block of wood, like the end of a building joist, a little
longer and wider than the 18 &times; 12-in. copper sheet.
Out of it make a mould the shape of the body of the
tray, by cutting the wood away. This mould is made
similar to the one you made when making the round
tray. If the mould is made carefully and according
to the pattern it is a simple matter to nail the sheet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of copper over the depression, and drive it in with
a wooden peg and mallet, making it fit every part
of the mould. Before this is done it may be necessary
to anneal the metal two or three times. Do
so as often as you need to, it doesn't matter how
often it must be done. When the surface is smooth
to the touch, take the metal off the mould, and turn
up the edges like the design. File off the outer edges
perfectly smooth and rub them down with
emery cloth. If your wooden peg has made small
dents or flat places, leave them as a finish unless
they seem too high or too low. The marks
made by any wooden tool usually make a beautiful
finish.</p>

<p><i>Handles:</i> The handles are hollow. They are
made by taking one piece of the 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 2-in. and
drawing on this the outline of the handle. Repeat
this on the four pieces. This makes four
halves. With a pair of shears cut along the sides.
Cut the rest out with a chisel. Snip the corners.
Put four pieces together and place between the
jaws of the vise. File into shape. This makes
each piece a duplicate of the others. Place each
piece of copper on a hard wood block and with the
round end of the raising hammer drive into the
block, hollowing it out. Make them in pairs so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that when the two parts are put together they
make the handles hollow on the inside and oval on
the outside. File the edges of the handle so that
they meet close. Bind, solder, and file and round
them up.</p>

<p><i>Fastening handles on the tray:</i> Saw the two ends
along the soldered joints about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. Open these
out so that they fit over the edge of the tray. Finish
the ends off either rounding or square. Now drill
a hole through the handle about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. from the end.
Place them again on the tray just where they
should be and mark for the hole to be drilled through
the tray.</p>

<p><i>Rivets:</i> Take a piece of silver wire the size of the
hole. Place one end of it on the vise so it will stick
up about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. above the surface. With the planishing
hammer, hammer a small rounded head on
the end of the wire. Cut it off <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. from the head
in length. This makes a rivet. You will need four.
Place these rivets with the head toward the front
part of the tray and fasten the handle on. Polish
and finish as you did other pieces of work.</p>


<h4>DUTCH BOWL (MADE IN SILVER OR COPPER)</h4>

<p>This Dutch bowl looks well made of either silver
or copper. It is worked up in the same way as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the other bowls described here, the little sawed
out handle on the side being an addition which
gives to the bowl
its Dutch characteristic.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_094.jpg" width="400" height="387" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Dutch bowls</div>
</div>

<p><i>To make the handles:</i>
If the bowl
is made of copper
select a piece of
metal thicker than
the copper used
for the bowl.
This piece is 3 &times; 4
ins. long. Shape
it as shown in the sketch. Mark the design and
saw it out. Now bend it at right angles about
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. from the end. Before the corners are
squared up, round the handle to fit the shape of the
bowl. This is best done on a round iron stake.
File into shape, drill three holes, and rivet the
handles in place. A soldered handle if desired makes
a neater piece of work than one riveted in place.
Material used is a piece of 3 &times; 3 ins. The design is
sawed out and shaped as before. However, in
place of bending the end down we file the circle to
fit the bowl. Clean the parts to be soldered, bind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the handle in place, wash with borax. Place bits
of solder about the joint, heat, and finish. If this
soldering makes the bowl very soft stiffen it by
hammering it lightly all over the surface.</p>

<h4>A SMOKERS' SET</h4>

<p>A smokers' set makes a very useful birthday gift
or Christmas present and is not hard to make. All the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
principles involved in the making have been worked
out in other problems that have been given. The
set consists of five pieces:
a large tray, a tobacco
jar, match safe, cigar box,
and ash tray.</p>

<div class="caption">Tray</div>
</div>

<p><i>Large tray (copper or
brass) oblong:</i> This design
shows a large oblong
tray with handles sawed
out of the sheet metal,
not riveted as the handles
were on the large serving
tray. Draw the
design for this tray on a sheet of paper. Mark
out the handles like those in the picture. Place the
pattern on the copper or
brass sheet, and cut out
the outline according
to the drawing. The
handles are not sawed
out until the tray has
been shaped up and finished.
This tray is
made out of a piece of No. 20 copper or brass,
and is 10 &times; 12 ins. With the dividers make a half-inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
line on the four sides of the sheet as shown by
the dotted lines in the sketch. Place this sheet in
the vise, the dotted line even with the jaws of the
vise. With the wooden peg, drive the sides up as
you did the small square tray. Drill the holes in
the slot and saw out for the hand-holds. File all
around and finish.</p>


<h4>MATCH SAFE</h4>

<p>This design shows a very simple arrangement
of a match safe holding a match box and a tray
to catch the burnt matches.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> Copper or brass&mdash;No. 20, 5 &times; 5 ins.,
for the tray. No. 20, 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 5 ins., for the holder.
No. 24, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 3 ins., for the centre piece. No. 20,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins., for the bar. No. 24, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 2 ins.,
for the stem.</p>

<p>This little holder is made up of five parts: base,
stem, holder, band, and centre piece for pushing
up the matches when the box is pushed down
into it.</p>

<p>The base is made by bending all four sides up
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in.; corners are made rounding. The stem piece
is bent into a cylinder tapered by wrapping it around
a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. tapered stick. Solder the edges, when
this is done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_098.jpg" width="500" height="508" alt="Match holder" />
</div>

<p>The holder itself is made by taking the 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 5-in.
strip and bending it up like the shape of a letter
U, so that it is a little longer than the match box
itself. The band holds the sides in place. All is
soldered together, the stem in the base first, then
the holder on the stem, etc. Hard solder is used.
The little centre piece is bent, placed in position,
and soldered with soft solder. Polish and finish.</p>


<h4>TOBACCO JAR</h4>

<p>This straight-sided jar is made in three pieces.
A disc 5 ins. in diameter is needed for the bottom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
a cylinder, 5 ins. deep, to fit the disc, and a lid made
from a 5-in. disc turned over to fit the outside.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="i_099"></a><img src="images/i_099.jpg" width="300" height="417" alt="Tobacco jar" />
<div class="caption"></div>
</div>

<p>The disc for the
bottom is bent up
like the base of the
tea caddy. Fit the
cylindrical piece
around this base and
solder where the
edges meet.</p>

<p><i>The lid:</i> Cut a
disc out of No. 20
copper, 5 ins. in diameter.
Find the
centre. With the
small end of the
planishing hammer
drive a boss into a hollow wooden block, about
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. deep. Out of this
boss the knob is made in the following way:
Take a piece of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. square iron and draw
about 4 ins. of the end tapered to a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. round.
Bend this up about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. as shown in the sketch.
This is the tool that the knob must be shaped
upon. Place this tool in the vise and place the
hollow of the lid on this tool. With the thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
end of the driving hammer work the knob in shape
from the outside. (See <a href="#i_099">sketch</a>.) During the working
of this metal it should be annealed three or
four times so that it will yield to the extreme
tension required to make the knob.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" width="600" height="564" alt="Hinges" />
</div>

<p>The lid is rounded in the same way as the bottom
piece was. There is some shaping to be done on
the top of the lid. The picture here shows that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
plainly. On the inside of the lid are two wires
soldered crosswise to hold a damp sponge in place.
This sponge keeps the tobacco moist. Finish and
polish.</p>


<h4>CIGAR BOX</h4>

<p>Any wooden cigar box may be decorated very
effectively. This picture shows an ordinary cigar
box with copper (or brass) trimmings. Corners are
sawed out and riveted hinges are placed on the top.
Boxes decorated in this way make splendid Christmas
gifts. A heavy sheet of brass or copper can take
the place of the wooden lid.</p>

<h4>ASH TRAY</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_101.jpg" width="600" height="196" alt="Ash tray" />
</div>

<p>Ash trays are of various shapes and sizes. Some
are merely a square tray, some are round, while
others are half-bowl shaped. Sometimes two or
three half-round tube-shaped pieces for holding the
cigar are soldered on to the rim of the tray. All
ash trays of this style are driven up in the same way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
as you drive up a square tray or a round one, or a
copper bowl. To make the cigar holders, cut a
piece of thin copper or brass 1 &times; 2 ins. rounding on
the ends. Place them on a block and round them
up in a depression cut out of the wood with a gouge
chisel. These are soldered on to the rim of the
bowl or tray with soft solder. Polish and finish.</p>


<h4>LOVING CUP WITH TWO OR THREE HANDLES</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="i_102"></a><img src="images/i_102.jpg" width="500" height="224" alt="Loving cups" />
</div>

<p><i>Material:</i> For bowl, copper 12<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 6 ins., No.
20. For base, copper 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins., No. 20. For
handles, 2 pieces or 3 pieces of copper 8 &times; 1 in.,
No. 20. Solder.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Combination stake, anvil stake, shears,
drill press, drills, rivets, shaping hammer.</p>

<p><i>Directions&mdash;Bowl:</i> Bend the 12<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 6-in. piece
of copper into a cylinder over the combination
stake. The two edges should just meet, and fit
perfectly along the line. Scrape inside and outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the joint. Wash with borax, bind with binding
wire, and solder. Be careful to heat it all over
the fire till the solder runs freely and fills every
part of the joint. Cool off, then round it up again
in the stake, filing off the surplus silver solder inside
and outside. Hammer the joint down till flat
and true. If carefully done this will show a thin
even line of silver.</p>

<p><i>Base:</i> 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. Cut a 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. disc. Place
the cylinder just made on the disc, allowing the
surplus to extend out evenly all around. Draw with
a pencil the outline of the cylinder on the disc.
The rim must be turned up at right angles to the
circle so that it fits exactly over the cylinder. To
do this, place the edge of the disc on the sharp edge
of the anvil stake, driving the edge over. Anneal
and repeat until the sides are at right angles to the
base. File off the top perfectly even, rounding out
the edges. This makes a finish and border to the
base. Push the cylinder into the bottom. Prepare,
as usual, for soldering. Be careful to put
bits of solder both around the edge of the turned
up flange, and on the inside bottom edge. Heat
and finish.</p>

<p><i>Handles:</i> Copper pieces, 8 &times; 1 in. Cut a tapered
slip off each side of the handle pieces, until the large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
end is one inch wide and the small end <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. With
dividers draw <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. line parallel to those sides.
Bend each side back on this line. Shape the handle
(see <a href="#i_102">design</a>) over the combination stake, using the
fingers or mallet to do so. The top of the handles
should fit up close against the top of the cylinder
and should extend down about <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the depth
of the bowl. The ends may be rounded off nicely
with the shears, and filed. A <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. hole must now
be drilled in each side. Place the handle in the
proper position on the bowl. Mark the holes and
drill them where the marks are made. Place rivets
and rivet the handles on. A touch of soft solder
will help keep these handles in place and at the
same time will prevent any possible chance for
leakage through rivet holes, for where you have
rivets you are apt to have a leak. Clean, polish,
and finish.</p>


<h4>COPPER BELT BUCKLE</h4>

<p>Buckles may be made of copper, silver, or brass,
and the process of making them is very simple.
This design shows a buckle for a man or a boy.</p>

Put it into the vise and bend it into a rectangular
frame like the design. Be careful to make rounding
corners and the
sides parallel to
each other. Cut
off the surplus
metal. Make the
joint in one corner.
Solder and
file the corner the same shape as the other three.</p>

with the top of the metal and make the column
perfectly round. Place the column on the raised
part of the base and mark around the column on
the base with a pencil. Saw out a hole along the
marked line. Push the end of the column in so
that it is perpendicular to the base and perfectly
true all around. Tie it in place for soldering, with
the binding wire, by fastening the wire on the extreme
top of the column, and carrying it to the four
corners of the base. This centres the column ready
for soldering. Wash the joint well, place pieces
of silver around the base and column, and heat.
The base should be crowned from the centre to the
outer edge. To do this, place the centre on any
round top wood block. Strike on the outer edges
with the wooden mallet until the desired crown is
formed. See that it stands plumb and does not rock.
If it does rock, tap the base gently on the outer
edges with the mallet until it stands firm. File<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and polish until the surface is perfectly smooth and
free from marks of all kinds. The beautiful colours
that form on the surface of copper depend much
upon the finish. The body of the lamp is now
ready for the cap and arms that hold the shade.</p>

all three rods. Wash the rivet joints with borax,
and solder. File off any projecting parts so that
the inside is flush, as this cap must fit over the
column. Place the cap over the column and between
the projecting arms drill a small hole through
both the cap and the column, and rivet as
before.</p>

<p><i>Shade, 4-sided or 6-sided:</i> This design is for 6
sides. That gives a good proportion.</p>

<p><i>Dimensions of each side:</i> Side (on a slant) 9

Cut out a pattern for one side. Use stiff card board.
Lay this design on a piece of copper large enough
to cut out the whole lamp shade. Mark around
the pattern. Lay the same pattern against one
side of the marked design. Make it fit exactly
along the margin line. Repeat until you have done
six sides. You have now a fan shaped pattern
with six divisions. Cut this along the top and
bottom lines.</p>

<p>If folded up along these division lines it would
shape up into a lamp shade. All lamp shades have
glass for light. We provide for the glass by cutting
out a section of each of the six faces. Take your
card board pattern. Mark a line all around from
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. and parallel to the sides, 1 in. from the top
and 1 in. from the bottom. Cut out the inner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
section made by these lines. Place the pattern
on the copper and mark each section. Cut it out
with the cold chisel on the wooden block. File
up the rough places left, make the edges square and
smooth. Bend up each section along the centre
line in the following way: Get two pieces of wood,
2 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 20 ins. Place the two pieces in a vise
and slip the copper between the pieces down to
the line where it should be bent. Tighten up on
the vise, press the copper over with the hands and
tap gently along the lines with the mallet, keeping
the angles about 60&deg;. Do this on each of the six
sides. If carefully done the shade will have a
hexagonal shape. The open parts should come
together, one side overlapping about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. Hammer
down the overlapping part and rivet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p><i>Glass:</i> Cut a piece of card board <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. larger all
around than the opening in the sections for the glass.
Take this to a glazier. Tell the dealer just what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
wanted and he will make suggestions as to colour,
kinds of glass, etc. Cathedral or opalescent glass
is very decorative.</p>

</div>

<p><i>To set the glass:</i>
Place one of the
panes of glass on
the inside of the
section, over the
open space. Mark all around it. Take 4 pieces of
copper (<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.) and bend them in a double
angle.</p>

<p>These are to be soldered or riveted on the rim. One
is placed on either side, one at the top and one at
the bottom. This glass rests in these brackets and
keeps it in place. Repeat for the six sections.
Push the brackets down against the glass after it is
in place. They hold it firm against the side of the
shade.</p>

<p>The design for this shade lends itself to many
variations. It may be square, five-sided, six-sided.
The edges can be escalloped both top and bottom,
and a sawed out design may be made to fit over
the glass.</p>

HINGES IN COPPER OR SILVER</small></h3>

<h4>TUBE DRAWING AND WIRE DRAWING</h4>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="materials">Material:</span> Copper or Silver.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Hardwood block, 6 &times; 3 &times; 1 in.
draw plate, tongs, sharp peen hammer,
saw frame and saw, round file, shears, small
piece of soap.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_116.jpg" width="400" height="402" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Stamp box, or jewel box with tube hinge</div>
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> To make
a good hinge for jewel
boxes or jewellery requires
some knowledge
of how to make wire
and tubes out of sheet
metal. In order to do
this you must have a
draw plate and that
you can make yourself, in the following way: Take
a piece of iron <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 3 ins. or 4 ins. long. Drill
a number of graduated holes through the piece along
the centre. The smallest hole should be about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub> in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in diameter and the largest, about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. Take your
steel punch and file the end down, tapering so that
the point will go into the smallest hole. Drive
the punch into the hole until it just goes through.
These holes take the shape of the tapered punch.
Repeat this in each hole until the draw plate is made
up of a number of graduated tapering holes. Your
draw plate is used for reducing wires from a large size
to any size you have holes for and for making hollow
tubing for hinges.</p>

<p><i>To reduce wire:</i> You can always buy the wire
any thickness you wish, but many times a small
piece of wire is needed quickly and can be made with
little trouble.</p>

<p>If you should wish to reduce a piece of wire <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>
in. thick to any size smaller than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in., file the end
of the piece so it just goes through the hole far
enough to grasp with the tongs. Rub a little soap
over the surface of the wire, draw it through the hole.
It is reduced to the size of the hole it goes through.
After the first or second operation the wire must be
annealed, as pulling it through the draw plate
hardens it.</p>

<p><i>Tubing for hinges:</i> Cut a strip of No. 28, copper
(or silver) any length. Cut the width of it three
times the diameter of the tube you wish to make,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and cut the end of this piece to a point. Place
your 6 &times; 1 &times; 3-in. block in the vise. With a round
file, file a groove across the block.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_118.jpg" width="600" height="520" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Shaping tube before drawing in plate</div>
</div>

<p>Place the strip of copper or silver over the groove
and, using the hammer, drive the metal into the
groove, forming a gutter.</p>

<p>Repeat this until you have driven the copper into
a cylindrical shape. Put the pointed end through
the largest hole in the draw plate. Rub well with
soap. Clasp the end sticking through with the tongs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and pull it through. Repeat as you did when drawing
wire through. Anneal when necessary. Continue
to put the tube in one reducing hole after
another until the tube is the size you wish. This
tube with a small hole through the entire length is
used for fine hinges.</p>

<p><i>Fine hinges:</i> To make a hinge for a box, bracelet,
or any small dainty article that requires hinges,
take a piece of the tube made as described. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
you have decided just how long the hinge must be
to fit the article you are making, saw the tube into
three pieces, or five pieces, of equal length by placing
the tube in a vise. If it is to be a three-piece
hinge, two will be soldered on the one side and one
on the other, the two just far enough apart so that
the one is in position to fit exactly in between them.
When the three pieces are in place, a wire is pushed
through the hole, and the hinge is made.</p>

<div class="caption">Filing half round groove in hinge, for tube</div>
</div>

<p><i>To make the wings of the hinge:</i> Take a piece of
silver or copper, No. 10, the length and width to be
determined by the size of the hinge. Place this
copper plate in the vise, file a groove through the
centre, just large enough for the copper or silver
tube to fit in about half its depth.</p>

<p>Saw the piece through the middle of the groove.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_121.jpg" width="400" height="125" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Bind in place with binding wire, and solder</div>
</div>

<p>Take two of the three short tube pieces, bind them
on the groove ends of one wing. Bind the third
piece of tubing in the middle of the groove end of
the other wing. Place the two wings together and see
that they fit closely. Do this with the greatest care,
as there is no possible chance for filing after the tubes
are soldered on the wings. Wash with borax, put
some silver solder on the joints, and solder as before
explained. When binding the tubes for soldering do
not put the binding wire through the holes of the tubes.
This wire makes a good conductor for the solder
which is apt to fill up the small holes in the tubes.</p>

<p>All binding should be done on the outside.</p>

<p>The wings of the hinges should be filed to a taper,
or any shape that will add to the appearance of the
hinge. The hinge lends itself very well for decorative
purposes and can always be made so that it
adds to the attractiveness of the piece of work.
Lock plates can be made by the same method.
They, too, can be finished up to add to the ornamental
side of the article.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
<i>Cabinet hinges:</i> Cabinet hinges are made either
of brass or copper. The hinge must be made in
proportion to the design, thus adding to the
decoration.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p><i>Material:</i> Strip of copper, No. 10. Cut out
according to the design.</p>

<p>The two ends of one are turned over a wire
nail <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. in diameter. The one end of the other is
treated in the same way. Test if they are true by
placing a wire through the three tubes. Cabinet
hinges may be finished by using the round head
hammer and driving down a number of hammer
marks, going all over the surface of the hinge. Or
they may be embossed from the under side. The
spacing of screws and rivets plays an important
part in the design of the hinge.</p>

6 &times; 4 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins., (inside measurements). The box
is to have feet, and a lid with hinges is to be fastened
to it. Take the strip of copper, 20 &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins.,
measure it off into sections of 4 ins. and 6 ins. alternately.
Beginning on one end mark a point <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.

left form the four feet for the box to rest upon.
To bend the corners, mark with lead-pencil <span class="smcap">C D</span>,
<span class="smcap">M S</span>, <span class="smcap">R T</span>. Place these division lines, in turn, between
the jaws of the vise, and bend down at right
angles. You now have a rectangular box like the
picture, with one corner open.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_125.jpg" width="400" height="296" alt="Box" />
</div>

<p>To close the
side, solder the
open end. Clean
thoroughly the
parts to be joined.
Place the parts in
their proper positions
and bind the
corner with binding
wire. Wash the joint with borax. Place
some small pieces of silver solder on the inside corner.
Hold it over a fire and heat until the solder runs
into the joint. Cool off in water and take off the
binding wire. If the solder should run through and
fasten the wire to the side of the box, the wire can
be peeled off and the solder filed down to the copper.
But care must be taken not to let the binding wire
sink into the copper. File up the corners smooth
and square up the box with a steel square.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
<i>To make the bottom of the box:</i> Take the piece of
No. 24 copper, 6<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 4<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> ins. Set the dividers
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. wide. With one leg on the edge of this plate,
draw lines on the four sides.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_126a.jpg" width="300" height="179" alt="Cutting out base" />
</div>

<p>Cut out the small square made in each corner by
the crossing lines. Put the plate into the vise and
bend the four sides up along these lines. Try it,
to see if it just fits the inside of the box. It is the
bottom and must be exactly right or the box will
be out of square. Now take it out for drilling and
riveting. With the centre-punch prick points one
inch apart and midway
between the edge and
the base. Holes are
bored through these
punch marks, with the
drill press and a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in.
drill. The bottom is now ready to slip into the
box and to place for riveting. Put it in, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
bent edge turned down and flush with the lower
edge of the box. It is necessary first to fix the
bottom securely in place before all the rivets
can be put in. To do this we put one rivet
on each side. Take a sharp-pointed instrument,
stick it into the centre hole on each of the
four sides, whirl it round, and mark the place
where the hole should be drilled through. Take
the bottom out and prick punch these holes. Drill
the four holes, place the bottom back, and push
the copper nails through from the outside in, leaving
the head on the outside as decoration. If the head
should seem too large, reduce it by filing before
riveting. Cut the nail off, leaving about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. of
it projecting. With the hammer strike on this
projecting end, flatten it down until it covers up the
holes. This is called riveting. Now the bottom is
made firm so that any amount of drilling can be
done without throwing it out of place. Drill all the
rest of the holes and put a rivet in each one of them.
The heads of these nails add to the decoration if
they are put in carefully and at regular intervals.</p>

<p><i>To make the lid:</i> If you look at your design you
will see that the lid is raised a little in the centre
and that the edges extend <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. over the four sides
of the box. Take the 6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. piece of copper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
With lead pencil mark the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. lap over all around
the lid. Place the lid on the end of the square block.
With the round end of the raising hammer drive
down lightly all around the inside of the lead-pencil
mark, increasing the blows toward the centre. This
will make an oval-topped
shape. The
hammering is bound
to distort the edge
of the copper. Turn
the lid upside down
on the bench; with
the mallet strike
down on the top of
the raised part until
the edges flatten
down on the bench.
If any kinks should come from the hammering flatten
them by driving directly over them. The lid
should rest on the box without rocking.</p>

<p>Place this between the vise jaws, pressing the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>

wire. Fix both pieces of copper this way. Draw
the wire out. You have two cylindrical pieces of
copper 6 ins. long with wings attached. Divide one
of the pieces into six one-inch sections. Put this
between the vise jaws down to the rounding part.
With your jewellers' saw, saw close to the vise and
along the division lines, cutting out sections 2, 4, 6.</p>

<div class="caption">This sketch shows the method
of riveting the hinge to the
jewel box</div>
</div>

<p>File up all open parts so that the joints will
be at right angles to the hinge. Do this carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
or else they will not swing true when hinged together.
Use the cut hinge to measure off the sections on the
other hinge. Cut
out sections 1, 3,
5 on the second
hinge, allowing a
little on each section
for filing. Fit
the two parts together
and fasten
by pushing a wire through. Try the hinge to see
that it works true and snug. Select one of the
sides as the back of the box, put the lid on, with
the hinge in place. You will
notice that the thickness of
the hinge prevents the lid from
fitting down on the box. File
the side of the box down so the
hinge sets flush with the top,
and file the wings of the hinge
down to a taper. The wings
are to be riveted, one flat to the
under side of the lid, and the
other to the back, after bending
it down on the inside of the
box. See <a href="#i_130">section view</a>. Hinges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
are sometimes soldered in place. To do this, wash
the joints with a little soft-solder fluid. Heat the
box in the bunsen flame hot enough to make the
solder run in between the joints. File any rough
edges off, smooth down carefully, and polish.</p>


<h4>CEDAR CHEST (WITH BRASS TRIMMINGS)</h4>

<p>A plain cedar chest is much improved by the addition
of copper or brass trimmings. They add
strength, too, to the box.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="600" height="344" alt="Views of chest" />
</div>

<p>The design shows a cedar chest with hinges, corner
plates, handles, and lock plate. The screws can be
bought with pyramid-shaped heads, which resemble
hand-made rivets. They add very much to the
general effect of the whole. One must be guided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
by the size of the box in selecting the appropriate
screw decorations. This box is 12 &times; 20 &times; 36 ins.
The lid is 2 ins. deep.</p>

<p><i>Hinges:</i> The hinges should be made of No. 10
copper or brass, 3 ins. wide, and should extend
two-thirds of the way across the top and half way
down the back. This tends to keep the lid straight
and support the back of the box.</p>

<p><i>Lock plate:</i> The plate is made of a piece of
8 &times; 3 in. metal, the same thickness as the material
used in the hinges. The design should correspond to
the design of the hinges. The key way is in the
lock plate, toward the top.</p>

<p><i>Handles and handle plate:</i> The handles are made
of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. round copper or brass, large in the middle,
tapering toward the ends. These ends are turned
up, fitted into eye bolts and riveted into the handles.
The handles should be 10 &times; 4 ins., with the design
of the hinges and the lock plate carried out.</p>

<p><i>Corner plates:</i> These plates go on the four corners
of the chest. They are made of No. 14 metal.
Perhaps the simplest way to make them is to take
a piece of No. 14 metal and cut a 6-in. square.
Draw the diagonals. Cut out one of the four triangles
from this square. Now bend the piece along
the diagonal lines and you make a corner to fit on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the box. Solder this open corner to the box. In
making corners for the lid, make the same pattern
and trim it down to suit the depth of the lid.</p>

<p>The trimmings on the box can be left smooth or
they can be treated with the peen of the hammer
and a facet surface put on, which is done quickly
and is very decorative in effect.</p>

<p>The hinge part of the hinge is made as explained
in the article on hinge making. The metal used
here would be quite strong enough just to turn over
in the pin without soldering it first to the body of
the hinge piece.</p>

<p>Put the lock on the chest before the lock plate
is placed. This fixes the place for the key-hole;
otherwise one might get the key way too close to
the opening and find no lock that would fit it. The
handles are put in by means of screws, but a much
stronger one is made by using bolts and screws.
The bolts that hold the handle on the plate are
carried through the box, and a nut and washer
fasten them tight on the inside.</p>


<h4>DESK SET IN COPPER</h4>

<p>Ink well holder and pen tray. Book rack. Corners
for desk pad. Letter file. Bill file. Stamp
box. Paper cutter, letter opener, and book mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>


<h4>INK WELL HOLDER AND PEN TRAY</h4>

<p><i>Material:</i> No. 16 copper, 10<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins., for the
tray. No. 16 copper, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 8 ins., for the box.
No. 16 copper, 3 ins. square, for lid.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_134.jpg" width="600" height="522" alt="Ink well holder and pen tray" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Tray: You will notice, in the design
of the tray given, a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. ledge all around. The
inside of the tray is lowered <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. except a square
place in the centre toward the back large enough
for the box to set upon. The depression in the tray
is made in the same way as described before in making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the small square tray. You put it into the vise and
with a round wooden peg drive it in according to
the design. The ledge must remain parallel to the
bottom of the tray. Round it off by placing the
tray on the anvil stake and driving the proper curve
in it with the wooden mallet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_135.jpg" width="600" height="522" alt="Inkwells and holder" />
</div>

<p><i>Box or holder&mdash;Sides:</i> Take the copper piece,
8 &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. and divide it into 2-in. spaces. Bend
these at right angles to form a square box, the open
ends meeting at one side. Solder with hard solder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
<i>Lid:</i> Take the 3-in. square piece. Over a square
block the exact size of the inside of the box drive
the piece for the lid. The corners must be driven
down even so that the lid will fit on the top of the box;
otherwise the ink will evaporate. The hinge on
the lid is made with a drawn tube in the same way
as was described in the article on the making of
hinges. The box is now ready to be put on the tray.
File the surface of the projecting square flat, so that
the box will set level. Bind it down with binding
wire, and solder in the usual way.</p>

<p><i>Ring and ring post fastened to the box:</i> The post
is made of a piece of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. square copper. At a
distance of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. from the end a shoulder is filed on it,
with the stem long enough to go through the thickness
of the lid. A hole, too, is drilled through one
end of this post large enough for a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. copper ring
to be pushed through. This copper ring is made by
turning a piece of copper wire around a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. round
rod in a spiral shape. Cut off the ring or rings as
you need them. This ring is opened out, pushed
into the hole, and squeezed together. It acts as a
little handle to lift up the lid. A piece of blotting
paper the exact size of the lid is pushed into the
inside of it. This helps to keep the ink from evaporating.
If the piece of work has been carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
done there will be little finishing and filing to do.
You can readily see that the beauty of metal work
depends as much upon the finish as upon the design.</p>


<h4>BOOK-RACK</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" width="400" height="173" alt="Book rack" />
</div>

<p>Book-racks are most useful for holding choice
books on one's desk. They are made of heavy copper.
This design is made so that one can place any
number of books between them, by pushing the side
pieces out. All book-racks are made in the same way.
The design on the side pieces can be sawed out
(or pierced) or embossed, or the facets left by the
hammer will make a beautiful decoration. Any
design work, however, must be done while the copper
is in a straight piece, otherwise the bending is apt
to spoil the work.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> Two pieces of copper, No. 14, 12 &times; 6 ins.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> In the design shown here the edge
of the upright ends are rounded. Some have just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the corners rounded off. Decide upon the design
you wish. Cut it out, and file the copper sheet
accordingly. Make the edges of the whole rack
perfectly smooth and rounded. Mark off 6 ins.
from one end. Bend this at the 6-in. line at right
angles to the 8-in. piece. It is well to do the bending
over a wooden block in the vise, using a mallet so
as not to mar the metal. Polish and finish as before.</p>


<h4>METAL CORNERS FOR A DESK PAD</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_138.jpg" width="500" height="480" alt="Metal corner" />
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_139.jpg" width="300" height="207" alt="Metal corner" />
</div>

<p>Metal corners made of brass, copper, or silver
are found very useful for protecting the corners of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
blotters upon desks. They keep the corners from
curling up and add much to the general appearance
of any desk. The designs are many, but for all
practical purposes
the plain corners
seem best, as they
are more sanitary.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> The
pieces of metal 6 &times;
2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. No. 22.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_139a.jpg" width="500" height="245" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fold on dotted lines. Corners for blotter</div>
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Mark your copper sheet off like this
pattern. Now get a piece of wood, iron, or copper
about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. thick and just the shape of one of these
corner designs. This <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. thickness will be about
equal to the thickness of your blotter and the thickness
of the card-board. Take your copper sheet
and bend the ends along the lines marked on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
pattern, over the iron or wood form, driving
them down to fit the shape well. You now
have a triangular piece with an opening on one
side. This piece would slide over the corner of
a card-board pad usually cut about 24 &times; 18 ins.
Solder the edges together. It is necessary to rivet
these corners to the card-board to prevent their
slipping off easily. To do this drill a small hole
down through the under side close to the edge, slip
these corners on the card-board, push the iron form
in, and drive the rivet through the hole, through
the card-board against the iron plate, thus riveting
the corners to the card-board. Take out
the iron plate and repeat on the four corners. If
designs are to be made on metal, they must be
sawed out or pierced while the metal is in the
straight piece. Polish free from all roughness. A
piece of soft flannel or woollen cloth is glued on
the under side of these corners, so that the metal
cannot scratch the desk, or any polished surface it
rests upon.</p>


<h4>BILL FILE</h4>

<p>This is a useful article for filing notes or memoranda
of things that need immediate attention.
There is very little variety in design. The base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
can be made square, circular, six-sided, etc., and
decorated in many ways. It looks well either
in copper or brass. Only heavy copper should be
used, in order to give weight to the
base.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_141.jpg" width="150" height="333" alt="Bill file" />
</div>

<p><i>Material:</i> A 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. square of No.
10 copper. Rod of sharpened steel.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Take a piece of iron
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. Go to any scrap
heap for this. Place the copper sheet
over this block of iron, letting the
surplus metal extend evenly all around.
Put it into the vise with the corner
vertical. Tighten it up and drive the metal over
the corner till it touches the sides of the iron.
Do this on all the corners. Make the outside
of the metal fit tightly over this iron,
acting as a shape or form. If the metal should
feel springy before driving it up close, anneal
it. Notice that in driving these corners down
they are longer than the four sides, and they
suggest feet. If filed flat and smoothed up
you have a square box with a foot on each
corner. Take it off the iron form and make the
top rounding by driving it over the hollow block.
Now drill a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. hole through the middle. Place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the copper rod in the hole and solder with hard
solder.</p>


<h4>PAPER CUTTER, LETTER OPENER, BOOK MARK</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_142.jpg" width="600" height="122" alt="Paper cutter" />
</div>

<p><i>Paper cutter:</i> No article on a desk is more
useful than a good paper cutter. It may be one
with a plain flat blade, no marked handle and without
decoration aside from that of the metal itself
with its hammer marks left upon it. Again we may
have one with blade and handle, the blade either
pointed (sharp edged or blunt), the handle plain
or with sawed-out design. Those with pointed
blades are serviceable as letter openers too. Then
some designs have handles made long enough to
turn the end over, forming a raised handle.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> Piece of No. 20 copper, <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 9 ins.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="i_142a"></a><img src="images/i_142a.jpg" width="600" height="109" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Paper knife. Cut on dotted lines</div>
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> If the blade is to be pointed, take
your strip of copper and draw a line right through
the centre. Mark a point <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. on the end, either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
side of the centre line. Draw lines from these points
to the extreme ends of the other side. See dotted
lines in the <a href="#i_142a">sketch</a>.</p>

<p>File up the edges rounding, and polish the whole.
Select a piece of copper free from scratches and
marks of any kind for this work. This paper cutter
can be left smooth, or it can be decorated by the
marks left by the planishing hammer. These
marks give a good finish and look well.</p>


<h4>PAPER CUTTER WITH TURNED HANDLE</h4>

<p><i>Material:</i> Piece of No. 20 copper, <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 16 ins.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_143.jpg" width="600" height="109" alt="Paper cutter with turned handle" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Mark off lines on the copper strip
as you did to make the plain paper cutter. Carry
the tapering lines back 7 ins. Cut off these side
pieces with shears. File the edges for the whole
length smooth. If any decorating is to be done,
do it while the copper is in the straight piece, as it
can't be done easily after the handle is turned.
All filing, too, must be done before the handle is
turned. When filed and smoothed up or decorated
as you wish, bend half the remaining 9 inches of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
copper over and on to the blade, in this way forming
the handle. The size of the handle will depend
upon one's feeling of comfort or discomfort about it.
If the edges still feel a little rough a piece of emery
cloth will smooth them down.</p>


<h4>LETTER OPENERS</h4>

<p>Letter openers are really small paper cutters and
are made in exactly the same way. They are shorter
and narrower than the paper cutter, but almost
always have a sharp pointed blade. Many scraps
of copper left over after the making of large pieces
can be used to make letter openers.</p>


<h4>BOOK MARK</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_144.jpg" width="500" height="189" alt="Bookmark" />
</div>

<p>Book marks are very handy to have on one's desk.
They are easily made and if very light copper is used
need not be heavy or clumsy. They should be
made very smooth, for they must slip easily into
place in the book.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> No. 30 copper, 3 &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
<i>Directions:</i> This drawing can be used as the
guide. Make it the required size and work just
as you did when making the paper cutter. The
little tongue on the inside is sawed out. It should
swing easily to and fro, as it must be pushed open to
catch the pages of a book and clamp them down.
File and finish very smooth. If it is left the least
bit rough it would tear the paper as it is pushed in.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="materials">Brass:</span> Brass is an alloy of copper and
zinc. The zinc colours the copper and gives
it the yellowish or brassy look, depending
upon the amount of zinc melted with it. While
the operations are the same whether you are working
with brass, copper, or silver, the presence of
the zinc in brass makes it less pliable than the pure
metals. That is why brass hardens so quickly under
hammering, making it necessary to anneal the metal
very often in order to work it. But zinc and copper
combined melt at a lower temperature than copper
or silver pure, so that great care must be taken
when preparing the metal for soldering or annealing
that you do not heat it over a dull red heat
before plunging it into water.</p>


<h4>TO MAKE A BRASS FINGER BOWL</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_150.jpg" width="300" height="257" alt="Bowl" />
</div>

<p>Finger bowls of brass are very ornamental and
useful and can be made of the simplest designs. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
half dozen are a welcome addition to any table.
Design the bowl and proceed
exactly as you did with the
copper bowl, working the
sheet of brass up into a
rough bowl shape on the
hard wood block. Using the
same tools, finish the bowl
on the round stake. The surface of the bowl may
be left mottled, or it can be smoothed up, as one
wishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
These sketches suggest a number of articles that
can be made out of brass.</p>


<h4>CRUMB TRAY AND SCRAPER</h4>

<p><i>Material:</i> One piece of brass, 10 &times; 6 ins., No. 16.
One piece of brass, 12 &times; 4 ins., No. 16.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_151.jpg" width="600" height="114" alt="Scraper" />
</div>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Anvil stake, mallet, shears, dividers.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> With the dividers set at 5 ins., one
leg of the dividers tangent with the top of the brass
plate and the other in the centre lengthwise of the
piece, draw a circle. Cut around the circle with
the shears. Beat over <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. of the centre part of
the circle, tapering along the circle line toward
each end. Round up this edge and curve it a little
inward on wood block so that when grasped by
the fingers it will be comfortable. Smooth off
edge and make the flat part perfectly straight, so
that when placed on the table to receive the crumbs
it will lie perfectly flat.</p>


<h4>CRUMB SCRAPER</h4>

<p>A very simple design is given here. Mark out
the dimensions on a sheet of paper and lay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
design on a sheet of brass. Cut the brass out to fit
the design. Using the mallet, drive up the rounding
part on the anvil stake
to match the rounding part
on the tray.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_152.jpg" width="250" height="151" alt="Marked up brass" />
</div>

<p><i>Handle of scraper:</i> Place
the handle part on a hard
wood block and with the small end of the raising
hammer drive down on the handle, embossing
it from the outside toward the front. Give
it a half hollow shape. If the edge of the handle is
smoothed off with a file
and made rounding, it
makes a good handle
for the scraper. Flatten
the scraping edge
so that it lies flat on
the table and picks up
all the crumbs on its
way to the tray. Polish
and finish as you did
the tray.</p>

<img src="images/i_153.jpg" width="400" height="201" alt="Forming cylinder" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Take the piece of brass 11 &times; 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins.
Bend it till the edges meet to make a cylinder.
Bind it round with a piece of binding wire. See
that the edges come together tight. Wash with
borax. Use silver solder and proceed as before
with soldering. Cool in water, clean off the joint
both inside and outside till the surplus silver is
filed off smooth. This leaves a fine joint line which
will take on the colour of brass in time and will
scarcely be noticed. Round the cylinder up by
placing it on a round stake or on a round wood
block. Tap gently with your mallet to do this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bottom:</i> Take the 3<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. disc. Draw a circle
on it equal to the bottom of the cylinder. Put
the anvil stake into the vise. With the edge of
the circle on the square end of the stake, drive the
metal with the driving hammer, so that the upturned
rim is at right angles to the disc. Test this
to see that the rim stands up all round and fits
the outside of the cylinder close. File the top edge
of this smooth and a little rounding. Shape up
and solder as you would a copper piece, keeping
in mind the low melting point of brass. The heating
of the bottom for soldering must heat the body
of the caddy to a red heat and there is danger of
unsoldering the part done. To prevent this melting,
the soldered joint should be painted both inside
and outside with rouge or ordinary clay wash. Mix
a little clay in a saucer to a liquid and rub it over
the joint. If the soldering is carefully done there
will be little filing to do afterward.</p>

<p><i>Rim (for the body):</i> Take your 11 &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. piece.
Bend it into a circle to fit the inside of the body.
Cut it off the right length, bind and solder the two
ends together. Clean off, round up on the stake,
and make it just large enough to drive it into the
top, pushing it down until about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. extends
above the cylinder. This supports the rim of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the lid. If it is driven down tight it will hold of
itself in place. If not, use a little soft solder to
make it secure.</p>

<p><i>Lid:</i> One square piece, 4<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. Take the mould
used for your round tray. Punch holes in each
corner of the brass plate, and nail it right over the
depression as you did when you made the round
tray. With your round peg drive the metal into
the depression. When the metal is perfectly smooth
and fits the impression take it out. Place the body
of the caddy over the top of this lid piece and mark
around it. Make a second circle <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. beyond the
one just made. Cut out along the outer circle.
Now draw a circle on the inside of the lid equal
to the body of the tea caddy. Place the lid on the
anvil stake and turn it up as you did the bottom
piece. This should be made the same size as the
bottom, as it must fit over the same diameter.
Make the rim for the lid in the same way as you did
the rim for the body. Round it up. Be careful that
the rim of the lid fits over the rim of the body and
that the diameter of the rim on the lid equals the
diameter of the body of the caddy. Place the rim
on the lid and soft solder it.</p>

<p><i>To decorate:</i> With the steel stippling tool mark
any little design on the surface of the lid or body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
or both, pricking up the design. Finish the work
by polishing the same way as copper is polished.
You can prevent its tarnishing by the use of lacquer.
This lacquer can be bought at any paint shop. It
is put on with a brush and left to dry. The lacquer
being transparent does not cover up any of the
design.</p>


<h4>VASE (IN BRASS)</h4>

<p><i>Material:</i> Yellow brass, No. 20. One piece,
7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 9 ins. (for the body). One piece, 5-in. disc
(for base). Handles, 2 pieces, 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
&times; <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> ins. square.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_156.jpg" width="200" height="261" alt="Vase" />
</div>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Hard wood block, shears,
anvil stake, files, raising hammer,
carpenters' gouge, chisel.</p>

<p><i>Design:</i> Vase, 7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. high, with
a diameter at the top of 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in.
The body tapers toward the base. Two handles,
one on each side, to be designed according to taste.
The base is to be weighted in order to insure safety
when in use for flowers, etc.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Make a pattern for the vase in
the following way: Draw a 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. circle. Using
the same centre, draw a 1-in. circle inside the
2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="i_157"></a><img src="images/i_157.jpg" width="500" height="463" alt="Cutout for vase" />
</div>

<p>Through the centre of these circles draw a line 9
ins. long; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. below the outer circle, over this
centre line draw a line 1 in. long, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. on one side
and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. on the other. Seven inches below this
1-in. line draw a 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. line, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. on one side and
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. on the other. Connect the inside points
of each line with the top line (see <a href="#i_157">design</a>), drawing
lines between the two points. If the pattern is
carefully developed from the drawing the metal
will fold up in the right way for a vase. To do
this, continue the tapering lines beyond the circle
until the two lines intersect. With the point of
the compass on the point of intersection, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
pencil point where the sides meet the 1-in. line, draw
an arc of a circle any length. Using the same centre,
open the compass until the pencil reaches the base
lines. Draw an arc of a circle any length. Use
your 30&deg; and 60&deg; angle and divide the half of the
circle into 6 equal parts. Take one of these 6
divisions with your compass, and step off their
distance on the large circle 12 times. You now have
the exact circumference for the top of the vase.
Draw lines from these points to the point of intersection.
This marks off the small circle or base.
Connect the 12-in. point on the top and bottom with
solid lines. Cut this pattern out and lay it on the
metal. Cut out the metal and fold up. It should
fit the drawing. The edges should meet close.
Clean, bind, and solder as you did with the copper
work.</p>

<p><i>Base:</i> Use the hard wood block and drive up the
5-in. disc over the depression. Shape it as nearly
as you can like the design, using the same method
as you did with the copper bowl. Keep annealing
this brass whenever it feels springy. Place it on
the anvil stake. Use the driving hammer and shape
it.</p>

<div class="caption">Drawn to scale <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch = 1 inch</div>
</div>

<p>Repeat the annealing and hammering until the
desired shape is gotten. Notice in the design that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>the neck is a little smaller than the bottom of the
vase. Place this small end on the
point of the anvil stake and swell
it out, forming a little rounding
collar so that the end of the vase
will slip in and fit tight. When
the end of the vase is in position,
wash the joint with a little soft-soldering
fluid, place a little soft
solder in the joint and heat until
it melts. Be careful that the solder
does not run over the collar.
It is so hard to file off the brass.</p>

<p><i>To weigh down the base:</i> Turn the
base upside down. Melt enough
soft lead to fill up the opening
level with the bottom. A circular piece of brass is
made to fit over the lead to hide it. Lap the edges
of the base over the piece just enough to hold this
and the lead in place.</p>

<p><i>Handles:</i> Handles are a matter of individual
taste. The vase can be left without handles if
desired.</p>

</div>

<p>Take two pieces of 5 &times; <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> ins. square; file into shape
according to the design. Bind the handles on the
body of the vase. Place a little silver solder wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the handles touch. Be careful to guard the
joint made by soldering the body of the vase with
clay or rouge, as was done when making the tea
caddy. Now you are ready to solder the body of
the vase and the base together. Push it in place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
see that it is perfectly straight, bind and solder.
If not well soldered it will not hold water. File
off the surplus solder, polish and lacquer as you did
the tea caddy.</p>


<h4>BELL AND BRACKET FOR A WALL DECORATION</h4>

<p>This stationary bell is very useful for any purpose
that a small bell
serves. It has the
advantage of being
always in one place.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> No. 20
brass, used for both
the bowl and bracket.
The size of the
design determines
the amount of material
used.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_163.jpg" width="300" height="506" alt="Bell and bracket" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Make
the bowl in the same
way as you did the
copper bowl, raising
hammer, wood
block, etc. The last
work done on this
bell should be of such a nature as to harden the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
metal so that the ring is clear. This clearness of
the sound depends upon the hardness of the metal.
The harder you can get the metal without splitting
it, the better the bell's tone.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_164.jpg" width="400" height="522" alt="Plate and hanger" />
</div>

<p><i>Bracket:</i> The bracket is made of two pieces, the
plate and the hanger. The plate can be made of
any design or shape suitable&mdash;square, oblong, oval,
or round.</p>

<p>Decide upon your design, mark this on the plate,
and cut out. Drill small hole for the nails to fasten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
it, either to the wall or to a small piece of hard wood
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. thick for a backing.</p>

<p><i>Hanger:</i> The hanger can be made of flat, square,
or round material. This picture shows a design
made of No. 20 brass. It is cut tapering and shaped
over a round wood block in the vise. The slots are
sawed out as shown. The bell is fastened to the
hanger by means of two or three links formed together
in a chain, one large enough to hook over
the hanger, and connected to the bell with a little
eye bolt made of brass, which is pushed through the
bell and riveted on the inside.</p>

<p>The ringing of the bell is done by a small brass
rod fastened to the hanger with a small chain.
The work is finished up by the use of pumice stone.</p>

<h3><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV<br /><br /><small>
FINGER RINGS, SCARF PINS</small></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="materials">Silver:</span> There is very little difference in
the handling and working of silver from that
of brass and copper. The same operations
are carried out and the same tools are used. Silver
is more pliable than either one of the other metals,
though copper is softer. However, silver melts at a
lower temperature than copper or brass, and for
that reason greater care must be taken during
the process of annealing, soldering, and enamelling.</p>

<p>Silver, of course, is the most precious metal you
have worked with. So then the cost of the material
limits one to the working out of comparatively small
problems. When buying silver, always buy sterling.
The sterling silver is made especially for silversmiths
and is used in all silver work, pure silver
being too soft to stand the wear that is required.</p>

<p>While copper is sold by the pound, silver is sold
by the ounce, and rolled out to any thickness you
wish. But the gauge is the same as that of copper,
a No. 20 in silver being the same as No. 20 in copper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
If the problems given here are carefully worked
out, enough practice in the handicraft of silver will
be given to enable you to work out much larger
problems in the metal.</p>

<p><i>Selecting stones for rings, pins, brooches, or bracelets:</i>
Choose the stones that are round or oval in shape,
and pick those that have a fairly level bed and are
well bevelled. This is necessary so that the bezel
will hold tight when rubbed against the stone.
Semi-precious and precious stones can be bought
at any dealer in stones, and one has his choice
out of many to pick from.</p>


<h4>FINGER RINGS</h4>

<p>Bands for finger rings are all made, practically,
in the same way. But there is a great difference
in the way stones are set in these bands. Perhaps
the three ways most generally used are: setting
by means of a bezel, or small band; prong setting,
and setting the stone down in a cavity cut in the
metal, just large enough to hold the stone.</p>

<p><i>Finger ring, stone set with a bezel:</i></p>

<p><i>Material:</i> One piece of silver, 2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins.,
No. 20, for ring. One piece of silver, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins.,
No. 28, for bezel. Stone. Silver solder. Borax.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Ring mandrel (you can make one yourself),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
small wood mallet, drill press and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in.
drill, saw frame and saw, centre-punch, small
Swiss files.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Directions&mdash;Pattern:</i> To
make a ring of this kind first
cut a piece of paper <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. wide and long enough
to go around the finger which the ring is to fit.
Straighten this piece of paper out. This gives
the length of the piece of silver needed for a ring.
Cut another piece of paper <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. wide to this
length. Draw with ink the pattern of the ring
on this second paper.</p>

<p>Cut the design out and paste it on the piece of
silver. With the centre-punch mark the centre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
each spot. Drill holes into each one. Saw out
the design. With a pair of shears cut off the surplus
metal. Be careful to save all the scraps.
They can all be returned and exchanged for silver
plate. File close to the design. You now have the
band ready for bending.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_172.jpg" width="500" height="249" alt="Bending the ring" />
</div>

<p><i>To bend the ring:</i> A ring mandrel is needed.
This is merely a tapering rod. One can buy steel
mandrels which are graduated for all sizes of rings.
A small tapered square punch which you can make
yourself, will be found helpful. Take a piece of
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. round or square steel. File the end, tapering
to a square point, 1 in. long. Harden it the same as
you did the half moon punch used to make the hat
pin. This punch is used for design work. Round
holes can be squared by driving the square punch
into the hole to any depth. This saves filing.</p>

<p>Place the ring mandrel in the vise. Using a wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
mallet, bend the ring in a circular shape over this
mandrel till the two ends meet. Try the ring on
the finger. Snip off the ends so that the ring fits
rather tightly. This will allow for stretching the ring
after it is soldered.</p>

<p><i>To put on the bezel:</i> Bend a piece of No. 28 silver,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins., around the stone. This can be done
with the thumb and finger. Make the silver fit
around the largest part of the stone. Snip off
the ends.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_173.jpg" width="200" height="199" alt="Binding the ring" />
</div>

<p>Bind the two ends with binding
wire, wash with borax, put a little
piece of silver on the inside and
heat over the bunsen burner; which
is hot enough for this kind of work.
Cool off in water, remove the binding wire. Each
end of this bezel must be filed to fit the circle of
the ring.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_173b.jpg" width="200" height="177" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Bezel for ring</div>
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_173c.jpg" width="250" height="119" alt="Binding bezel to ring" />
</div>

<p>When this is done bind the bezel
on, and at the same time bind the
lower part
of the ring
so that the
open ends fit tightly together.
Solder the bezel and the open part of
the ring at the same time. Wash all the joints.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Place silver solder on the inside of the bezel,
say one half-dozen pieces (small), round on the
inside, and also one or two small pieces on the joint
of the ring itself. Place the whole ring in the
bunsen flame. It will all heat up about the same
time. Watch the solder carefully. See that it
runs all around between the bezel and the body of
the ring. Cool off. Take off all the binding wire.
File the inside and outside of the bottom part of
the ring.</p>

<p>Place the ring on the mandrel and go over it
gently with a steel hammer, shaping it around and
making it to fit the finger. File the edges around
smoothly. Go over it all with a small square file
and file out all imperfections in the slots. Place a
piece of fine emery cloth on a tapered round wood
peg. By revolving it around this you polish and
trim up the inside of the ring. Using the same emery
cloth twisted around a flat stake or file, go over the
outside until the ring is free from scratches.</p>

<p><i>Stone:</i> If the bezel has been carefully made the
stone should drop right into place. If by chance
some of the solder should have filled up the bezel
space and made it smaller, take a sharp tool like
a pocket knife blade and scrape the inside of the
bezel till the stone fits. Place the stone. With a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
smooth piece of steel or very hard wood press the
bezel against the stone. The bezel is thin enough
to yield to this pressing process. It will cling to
the sides of the stone and prevent its falling out.
Polish the ring by rubbing it with pumice stone
and a piece of cloth. This finishes the work.</p>

<p><i>Finger rings, silver cut away to set stone in:</i></p>

<p><i>Material:</i> For this class
of work we require much
heavier silver than for the
other rings.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_175.jpg" width="300" height="236" alt="Cut away to set stone" />
</div>

<p>One piece of silver, No.
10, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> ins. Solder.
Borax.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Same as were used for the bezel setting.
In addition we shall need one or two small chisels,
which you can make yourself. Chasing tool.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Make the pattern of your ring as
you did before. Paste it on the silver piece, and cut
out. Bend the silver around the ring mandrel so
that it will fit the finger it is intended for, and solder.
Place the stone in its proper position and mark the
outline of it on the silver. Now you will need a
small chisel to chip away the silver and make the
space for the stone.</p>

<p><i>To make chisel:</i> Take two pieces of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
steel 5 ins. long. One piece is to make a flat chisel
and the other for an oval chisel. File the ends to
a chisel shape.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_176.jpg" width="600" height="63" alt="Steel piece" />
</div>

<p>This steel must be tempered before it can be used.
To do this place the ends just filed into the fire.
Heat about 1 in. of the end red hot. Cool <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. of
this hot end in the water till quite cold. Take it
out and rub the end with a piece of emery cloth till
it shines.</p>

<p>The colour will begin to flow toward the end.
When the blue colour reaches the end plunge the
whole piece into water. The oval chisel is used for
outlining the depression. The flat chisel is used for
levelling the bed to receive the stone. With this
chisel cut away the material inside the marked
outline, keeping a little inside the border line. Cut
away the silver to about the depth of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub> in. You
will find the opening a little smaller than the stone.
With your chasing tool drive around the inside of
the oval, undercutting until the stone fits in. This
undercutting drives up a little silver rim, which
does the work of a bezel on the stone. When this
rim is forced against the stone, the stone is held
in place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
The ring is now ready for the stone, but the
thickness of silver makes it large and clumsy.
Before putting the stone in, the ring should be filed
down to the proper dimensions. This requires
a great deal of filing. Use a rough file at first and
finish with a fine one. When the ring is shaped as
you wish polish up the inside and outside.</p>

<p><i>To place the stone:</i> With the ring mandrel on
the vise, put the stone in place and put the ring on
the mandrel. Tap gently on the silver rim, driving
it against the stone. Do not drive it too hard or
else you may crack the stone. Finish up and polish
as explained before.</p>

<p><i>Finger ring, stone set
with prongs:</i></p>

<p><i>Material:</i> One piece of
silver, No. 14, width and
length the same as the
others. Stone&mdash;in the design, square.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_177.jpg" width="300" height="201" alt="Stone set with prongs" />
</div>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Same as used in making the other rings.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Draw design, cut pattern, place it
on the silver, and cut out as before. Bend the ring
to fit the finger, and solder. After the silver band

put the band back on the mandrel. With the
planishing hammer strike down, flattening the top.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
This reduces the thickness of the ring and gives us
a flat surface, to which the prongs are soldered.</p>

<p><i>To make the prongs:</i> Place the stone on a No. 24
piece of silver. Draw the outline of the stone on
it. The square piece of silver should be <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.
larger all round than the size of the stone. A stone
may be set with 4 prongs, or 6 or 8, according to
one's taste. In this setting we have the 4 prongs.
Mark the outline of the prongs on the square piece
of silver according to this picture.</p>

<p>Saw out on the dotted lines. Cut a piece of copper
the exact size of the stone. Place the copper on
the silver and bend up the prongs at right angles
to the silver plate. Take away the copper, and file
the under part of the silver piece flat, and prepare
the upper part of the ring in the same way. Bind
the flat part of the prong piece to the flattened part
of the ring, and solder. If the flattening in the first
place has made the ring too large for the finger,
cut a piece out along the soldered joint. Fit it
to the finger and resolder. File all joints perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
smooth. The prongs should be filed carefully and
made perfectly even and of the exact size and shape.
Place the stone in and push the prongs against it.
Rub each separate prong down until it fits close
against the stone. This prevents their catching
on anything like cloth, etc. Polish and finish as
explained before.</p>

<p><i>Finger ring, made of twisted silver wire:</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_179.jpg" width="400" height="104" alt="Twisted wire ring" />
</div>

<p><i>Material:</i> No. 30 fine silver wire; length depends
upon the design of the ring.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Same as those used in making the other
rings described.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_179a.jpg" width="250" height="262" alt="Side view" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Cut off a piece of No. 30 wire about
6 ins. long. Bend it in the middle,
place the two ends in the vise
and, with a pair of pliers, grasp the
other end. Twist the wire into an
even twist. Select the stone. The
round stones are best for this
wire setting. In making this wire ring it is best
to make the setting for the stone first. Cut a
piece of wood the exact shape of the largest part
of the stone. Bend a piece of No. 30 silver <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
wide around the wood peg, till the two ends just
meet. Coil around this the twisted wire, one
strand upon the other, until you have about three
coils. Wash with a little borax; place a little
silver solder upon the under side of this coil. Heat
and solder the strands together; at the same time
solder the band on the inside. Place it on the
ring mandrel, and curve it to fit the shape of the
finger. Either press it with your fingers or use a
mallet.</p>

<p><i>The setting is now ready for the ring:</i> The ring can
be made either by twisting a piece of wire to fit the
finger or by using just the plain wire itself for the
ring band. In either case, the piece of silver used
for the band, plus the size of the setting, must equal
the size of the finger. Solder the two ends of the
ring band to the sides of the setting. File the inside
opening of the setting to a level; place the stone
in as you did the others. Clean and polish up as
usual.</p>


<h4>SCARF PIN</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_180.jpg" width="600" height="103" alt="Scarf pin" />
</div>

<p><i>Material:</i> A piece of No. 20 silver for the body
of the pin; the size is determined by the size of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
stone to be set. A piece of No. 24 for the bezel.
A piece of No. 20 silver wire for the pin. The pin
piece can be bought at any jewellery store, if you do
not wish to make your own. They are better, too,
than those you make yourself. Solder and borax.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Shears, files, draw plate.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Cut a piece of silver, No. 20, the size
of any one of the above designs. Cut a piece of
No. 24, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. wide and long enough to go around
the stone, to make a bezel. Be sure that this bezel
fits close and tight around the stone. Bind the
bezel, and solder. After soldering, fit the bezel again
to the stone, for the soldering is apt to change
the shape. File the
bottom off perfectly
flat; clean the surface
of that part to be
used for the back of the pin. Bind the bezel
on this piece, wash with borax, and solder it in
place.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Pin:</i> This can be bought at any jewellery store.
However, if you wish to make your own, you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
do so in the following manner: Place a piece of
No. 16 wire in the draw plate and reduce it a little.
This drawing through
the plate stiffens the
wire, and this is just
what is needed in a pin;
otherwise it would bend
when pushing it into the
scarf. When you think
it is stiff enough, file
the end to a long needle
point. Cut it off about
3 ins. long. Bend the
blunt end down at right
angles <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. Place this
end against the back of
the pin in such a way
that the bent end will
be against the plate and
a little above the centre. Bind it in place and solder
it on tight. Be careful to heat just as little of this
pin as possible, for you remember that heating a
piece of silver red hot softens it, and you must heat
it red hot to solder. So confine the heating to as
small a space as possible. Sometimes I soak a
piece of cloth in water and wrap it around the pin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
covering up all except the part to be soldered.
This prevents it from softening.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/i_183.jpg" width="100" height="684" alt="Pin design" />
</div>

<p><i>To place the stone:</i> The stone is put in and the
bezel is pushed against it and holds it in place.</p>

<p>This is a very plain scarf pin without
any pretence at design. Scarf pins can be
made in all shapes, sizes, and all sorts of cut
out designs.</p>

<p>All silver should be polished smooth and
made free from scratches. The polishing
hardens the surface of the metal. This is why
silver jewellery of all kinds becomes brighter
and smoother the longer it is worn.</p>

<p><i>Setting of stones in scarf pins:</i> There are
many ways of setting stones for scarf pins.
The setting just described is called a box
setting, the bezel forming the box to receive
the stone. The open or prong setting is
made in the same way as that kind of setting
is made for the stone in the ring.</p>

NECKLACES, BROOCHES, BRACELETS</small></h3>


<h4>NECKLACE</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_184.jpg" width="500" height="363" alt="Necklace design" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> necklace is made on the basis of a circle
7 ins. in diameter. Most necklaces having
pendants are about this size. The design
of this necklace is very simple. One
stone is set in the pendant and this
shows on both sides. The whole is connected
by silver links. The stones,
one either side of the pendant, between
the links of the chain, are set in the same
way as you set the stones in the scarf pin and rings.
The only work to be done which is different from any
you have done before is the making of chain links.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> No. 20 or 22 round silver wire, the
amount depending upon the size of the chain.
Stones, carefully selected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_185.jpg" width="600" height="416" alt="Pendant on chain" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Draw the design of your necklace
on a piece of paper. Place the stones at intervals.
When they seem well proportioned
draw the chain links between them.
The length of the links will depend
entirely upon your setting. When you
have decided just how many links go between
the stones on your design, measure off
the length of one of those links. Round
links do not hang as well as oval links,
neither do they look so well.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_185a.jpg" width="500" height="442" alt="Pendant on links" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_186.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="Making links" />
</div>

<p><i>To make the links:</i> Take a piece of
iron <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. in diameter and file the two
sides oval in shape. This is a bar on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
you can bend the links. One end of the silver
wire is placed against this mandrel and both put
into the vise and fastened.
Bend the wire round
and round this iron rod,
making the coils as close
as you can get them.
Count each revolution as
one link. You can easily count the number of
links in your necklace. When you get the number
of turns needed, unfasten it all from the vise
and pull the rod out. You have a spiral-shaped
coil. With a jewellers' saw, saw the length of the
spiral on the end of the links. Each one will
drop off in the shape of a link. This is the very
best way to bend up a number of links that will be
uniform in size. You will notice that the ends of
the link, after it is sawed off, are not opposite
each other. Push these ends together, using the
fingers or a pair of pliers. If the sawing is carefully
done the links will be ready to solder. Solder first
one link in the usual way. Hook the other link
into it. Repeat until the chain is the desired length.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
If the proper amount of solder is placed on the joint
it will run in without making lumps to be filed off
later.</p>

<p><i>Pendant:</i> The pendant is made in the same
way as the watch fob, which is explained
in a later chapter. The setting of the stones
in the chain is done as other stone setting,
except that the ends are filed into shape to
receive the links for joining. Fastenings for
the necklace can be bought at any jewellery
store. It is much better to buy them than to
attempt to make them.</p>

<p>Square silver wire can be used to mark out
the design, or any design, instead of round
wire, and great variety can be secured merely
by a change in the shape of the wire used
for the links. Again, you may have a necklace
with or without the pendant; the so-called
bar necklace, the dog collar, or the
chain may be lengthened until it becomes the
watch chain.</p>

<p>In the group picture of necklaces there is one
necklace made up of long flat links joined together
by small links soldered on. The design for
the necklace is sawed out. It is used for a necklace
and watch chain. This is only one of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
suggestions for sawed out design work applied in
this way.</p>


<h4>COLLAR SLIDE</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_188.jpg" width="600" height="130" alt="Colllar slides" />
</div>

<p>Collar slides make very pretty pieces of jewellery.
Three form a set, and they are easily made. These
given here are all made of silver with turquoise
setting. The centre slide is usually a trifle larger
than the other two. A piece of ribbon is slipped
through a little wire slot put on the back of each
slide for that purpose. Any colour ribbon that
blends with the silver and turquoise looks well.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> One piece silver, <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> ins. (for
centre slide). Two pieces silver, <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> ins. (for
other two). Three stones well matched. Piece
of No. 20 silver wire, 5 ins. long.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_189.jpg" width="250" height="206" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Collar slide</div>
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Cut out the shape as the picture
shows and saw out the inside according to the design,
leaving a flat space at the top large enough for the
stones you have selected. Set the stone the same as
you did stones for rings, scarf pins, etc. After
the bezel is in place for soldering, cut off a piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
No. 20 wire, and bend it in the shape of the sketch
given here.</p>

<p>This is soldered on the back of the slides. Bind
this on at the same time you
bind on your bezel, wash with
borax, and solder both. Do
same on each one. File down
the bezel, put the stone in
place and push the bezel against
the stone by rubbing. Polish and finish. This design
will no doubt suggest many ways of making slides.</p>


<h4>BROOCHES AND BAR PINS</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_189a.jpg" width="600" height="368" alt="Brooches and bar pins" />
</div>

<p>Brooches and bar pins are made in much the same
way as scarf pins. The bezel is soldered as to a flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
bar of silver to receive the stone. But, in place of
the stick pin, brooches have a bar, hinged on one
end, and a little catch hook on the other. These
bars and catch hooks can be bought very cheaply
at almost any jewellery store, and cheaper than one
can make them. However, if you wish to make
that part of the brooch or bar pin yourself you can
do so in the following way: Take a piece of silver
2 ins. long and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. wide, No. 20. Round this piece
of silver up by driving on the wide side about one
inch from the end. Keep doing this till the piece
of silver is about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. square. Drive the four
corners down, and you have an 8-sided bar. If
these corners in turn are hammered down you have
a 16-sided piece, etc. Continuous hammering reduces
this bar to a round piece of silver about one
inch long. The end should be flattened down according
to the sketch (1).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_190.jpg" width="500" height="260" alt="Bar" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
<i>To make the hinge (staple and hook):</i> Take a piece
of silver, No. 24, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. wide and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. long. Bend
it up in the shape of a staple, square at the end (2).
The piece for the hook can be made at the same
time you make the piece for the pin. Use a piece of
wire <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. long. After hammering, bend it
like the sketch (3).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="i_191"></a><img src="images/i_191.jpg" width="400" height="151" alt="Staple and hook" />
</div>

<p><i>To put the staple and hook together:</i> Drill a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in.
hole in the staple very close to the top. Drill one
in the flat shank of the pin also close to the top.
(See <a href="#i_191">sketch</a>.)</p>

<p>Put a silver rivet in and rivet the two together,
making a hinge. Place this on the bar pin or brooch
and then put the hook in its proper position. Now
you can get the exact length the pin should be.
Cut it off long enough to let the end project through
the hook about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. File this to a needle point and
polish very smooth. If it is rough it will not push
through any kind of cloth easily. To solder, bind
the pin and hook to the brooch or bar pin, and solder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
as you would any other piece. Polish and finish
up as you have done before.</p>


<h4>BRACELET WITH SAWED OUT DESIGN AND STONE
SETTINGS</h4>

<p><i>Material:</i> One piece of No. 20 silver, 8 &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> ins.
One piece of No.
24, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> in. by any
length needed for
the number of
bezels required.
Three or five
stones (turquoises
blend well with
silver).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_192.jpg" width="400" height="326" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Bracelet with stone</div>
</div>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Saws,
saw frame, drill press and drills, small files, borax
and solder.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Secure small stones of uniform size
and the same colour, or colours that blend well
together. If the stones selected are too large the
bracelet is apt to have a heavy or clumsy look.
Bracelets should be fine, and above everything else
dainty looking. Take your 8-in. piece of silver and
divide it into five equal parts if there are to be five
stones, and three equal parts if three stones are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
be used. Lay each stone in its section and mark
the outline with pencil on the silver.</p>

<p>The sawed out design is a matter of spacing between
the stones. The
design shown here is
a good one for this.
You will see that the
spaces between the
stones are cut away so that the stones stand out as
the design rather than the bracelet itself.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_193.jpg" width="300" height="72" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Section of bracelet</div>
</div>

<p>If you are working out the design given here,
drill holes and saw out the spaces. Do this while
the silver is in a straight piece, also file these slots
or spaces true and straight, rounding the edges
both ways. At the same time round the outside
edges both ways, too. This makes the bracelet
free from sharp edges and it will feel comfortable
to the touch.</p>

<p>Shape the bracelet, bending it as you have bent
other bands. There is danger, when bending
this, of the weak places, where the open spaces come,
bending in sharp angles. To avoid this put the
greatest strain on the solid places and bend these
first. Bring the two ends tight together, then bind
and solder. When you have taken off the binding
wire, file down any thickness left at this joint flush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
with the silver band. Bracelets are both oval
and round in shape. Choose one of the two shapes
and round the bracelet up in that form.</p>

<p>Now cut the silver for the bezels long enough to
go around each stone. These are all soldered in the
usual way, then filed to fit and lie flat on the bracelet.
Place the bezels on the solid places and bind
each one separately. Place a little bit of silver
solder on the inside of each. Be careful to wash the
joint made in the band with a little clay to prevent
its melting during the soldering of the bezels. If
the bracelet during the soldering has lost its shape
round it up again. File all the bezels down so that
the tops are perfectly smooth. File off any rough
spots in the circle or bracelet and polish it all inside
and outside. Shape a soft piece of pine wood to
fit the inside of the bracelet. Put this wood into the
vise and put the bracelet on it. Now set the stones,
one by one, and rub the bezels tight against them.
Polish with rouge or pumice.</p>


<h4>THE INDIAN BRACELET</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_195.jpg" width="400" height="343" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Indian bracelet</div>
</div>

<p>The open bracelet is really an Indian design.
Take a piece of silver wire, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> &times; 8 ins. long. Hardened
silver is best. It can be gotten just as silver
wire that has been softened can be bought. Cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
a piece <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. long from each end. Place these pieces
on a piece of charcoal. With the blow pipe melt
these pieces.
Each will run into
a little silver ball.
Solder the balls
to the end of the
silver wire, one on
each end. Bend
the wire now in
the shape of a
bracelet. You
can make the two balls just touch or you can leave
them about an inch apart. Polish in the usual way.
If the balls are carefully soldered on to the ends of
the wire they make a very effective decoration.</p>

SPOONS AND PICTURE FRAME</small></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="materials">Silver spoons:</span> (1) Teaspoon, (2) Sugar
tongs, (3) Mustard spoon, (4) Salt spoon and
salt-cellar.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> No. 8 sterling silver 6 &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Hard wood block, drill press and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. drills,
jewellers' saw and frame, files, shears, and raising
hammer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_196.jpg" width="600" height="212" alt="Spoons" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Examine carefully any teaspoons
you have at home. These will suggest ideas for
designs. They will give you a clearer notion of
how teaspoons are made than any sketch you may
see. When you have decided upon your design,
draw it on paper and cut out your pattern. Paste
this pattern upon the piece of silver. You cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
cut this metal with a pair of shears. Put it into
the vise and cut it out with a cold chisel as you did
the paper knife, or you can cut it out by placing it
upon the flat stake and, with the chisel held vertically,
driving the chisel into the silver. You will
find the vise best, however. Now you have the
outline of a spoon with the same thickness all the
way through. If you have examined a teaspoon
carefully you will see that the bowl of the spoon
itself is thinned toward the outer edge, and that the
handle is tapered toward the end. The thickness
of the metal is left at the short bend of the spoon
where it meets the bowl. Now place the large end
on the anvil stake and with the raising hammer
(round end) drive down on the metal, thinning
it out and at the same time shaping it into a spoon
bowl. Your silver widens out and makes the bowl
larger than it should be. Cut off the surplus
silver. It is much better to have to cut down to the
size than to be compelled to stretch the silver out,
as it were, to a certain size. In one case you can
stop when you have the proper thickness, but in
the other you might make the metal too thin for
practical purposes, in order to get it wide enough.</p>

<p><i>Handle:</i> Handles should be tapered out from the
thickest part to the end, and left large enough on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the end to saw out or file into shape any design you
may wish to make. Don't work your problem too
close so far as material is concerned. Any waste
material in silver can be returned and exchanged
for full value.</p>

<p>Hammering any metal hardens it. When this
silver becomes hardened anneal it, but just enough
to allow you to shape it up. However, the last
annealing should be done some time before the
hammering is finished so that the last work on it will
harden it sufficiently to prevent its bending when
in use. Hand made spoons have a beauty about
them not matched by those mechanically made.
If this handle is to have a sawed out design, the drilling
and sawing are done as before described.</p>

<p>The finishing should be carefully done. Round
the edges so that they feel smooth and comfortable.
After polishing, the spoon is ready for use.</p>


<h4>SUGAR TONGS WITH CLAWS</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
<i>Material:</i> No. 16 gauge silver, 9 &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Make your pattern and mark it off
on the strip of silver. Either saw or cut off the
surplus material. Drill two holes where the holes
are shown, for the claws. Saw down to these holes.
Do this on either end. You now have three prongs,
the middle one a little wider than the other two.
Take the pliers, grasp the points of the outer two
and turn them outward, forming a claw. File
them until they have the shape shown by the design.
Do the same on both ends. File the whole piece
up, rounding the edges nicely. Notice that the
edge view given in the drawing shows the centre
thinner than either side. This is flattened down
and the flattening of the silver hardens it, so that
when it is turned it acts like a spring. When you
have flattened the centre part out to the thickness
of the drawing, place it on a wood block and with a
chisel-shaped wood peg drive in the centre, making
the inside slightly concave, and rounding the top
side a little. This will bend the tongs like the design.
Shape the claw ends to fit the sketch on a hard wood
block, using a mallet. Before bending the silver
into shape take the wood peg, place the claws on the
wood block, and with the wood peg drive down
and slightly concave the centre of the claws. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
design work must be put in when the metal is in
a straight piece.</p>


<h4>SUGAR TONGS WITH BOWLS</h4>

<p>These are made in the same way as the tongs
with claws. In the place of claws you make the
bowl spoon shaped on the wooden block, using a
mallet. The spoon bowl should not be larger than
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. Finish and treat in the same way as
the sugar tongs with claws.</p>


<h4>MUSTARD SPOON, SALT SPOON AND CELLAR</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p><i>Material&mdash;Mustard spoon:</i> No. 14 silver, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> &times; 3
ins.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> To make a mustard spoon like the
sketch given here, measure <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. off the end of the
silver stock. This makes the bowl of the spoon.
Flatten the end down, thinning it out toward the
edge. File the bowl round. Place it on a block
and hammer it into a plain simple bowl shape very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
deep. One inch from the handle end flatten it
out, thinning it out toward the end. File to shape,
and bend as shown in the sketch, similar to a teaspoon.</p>


<h4>SALT SPOON AND CELLAR</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p><i>Material&mdash;Spoon:</i> <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> &times; 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins., No. 14.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Salt spoons are made in the same way
as mustard spoons. However, the handle is shorter,
and the bowl is oval shaped and not quite so deep.
Any little sawed out design may be placed on the
handle, same as the teaspoon
design. Using the
same design, a set can be
made to match.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Take the 3-in. silver disc. Draw on
it a 1-in. circle in the middle. Place it on an anvil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
stake and drive it into shape like the sketch given
here. This is done in the same way as the base of
the chalice was hammered up. Hammer marks
should be left. They add to the design itself.
When you have driven it up, see that the bottom
is flat, so that it sits level on the table. Trim the
top off and file the edges round.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_202.jpg" width="250" height="245" alt="Salt-cellar with fluted sides" />
</div>

<p><i>Salt-cellars with fluted sides:</i> There are many
ways of making salt-cellars.
Some have straight sides,
some have tops bent over,
some are saucer shaped, and
some have fluted sides. Take
the 3-in. disc, and divide it
into 12 equal parts. File out
in a hollow block a round depression and with the
mallet and a wood peg to fit the depressions
drive each of the divisions into the depression.
Narrow the scallops toward the bottom, both in
width and depth. Keep within the angle formed
by the divisions. As you repeat one after the
other you will notice the sides beginning to turn up
and shape themselves into a cup similar to the first
salt-cellar. The base of this should be one inch
in diameter. Finish up and file as you did the
others.</p>

<h4>SMALL SILVER PICTURE FRAME</h4>

<p><i>Material:</i> One piece No. 24, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 13 ins. One piece
No. 24, 3-in. disc (2-in. hole sawed out of centre).
One piece No. 24, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins., for feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_203.jpg" width="600" height="369" alt="Picture frame" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Bend the strip of silver, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 13 ins.,
to fit the outside edge of the disc. Cut off the ends,
and solder. Push the disc into the ring made and
solder the ring into the disc, keeping the edges
flush with the surface of the disc. File off the
soldered joints smoothly.</p>

<p><i>Feet:</i> Saw out the design for the feet according
to the drawing, and solder them on to the back edge
of any part of the circle. This must be done with
hard solder. Before soldering the feet on, paint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the joints already soldered with clay, wash and paint
the opening where the heat is applied for soldering
on the feet. The edge of the 2-in. circle is bevelled
slightly. To do this place the edge on an anvil
stake and with a very light hammer drive gently
down, bending inwardly. If this is carefully done
it will require no finishing except the polishing.</p>

<p>The frame is now ready for the glass. Any kind
of window glass may be cut to fit the inside. A little
card board frame is made to hold the glass and
picture into place. Take a strip of card board <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
in. wide, long enough to bend into a circle to fit the
inside of the silver frame tightly. Cut a disc of
card board to fit the card board circle. Glue the
disc and circle together. Cover with velvet, so
as to hide the card board. Fasten to the back a
little stand for holding the picture in proper position.
This, too, is made of card board and covered with
the same material.</p>

<h4>WATCH FOBS OF SILVER OR COPPER BACKGROUND,
WITH SILVER INITIALS</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> few designs shown here are easily
worked out in either metal. Many handsome
watch fobs of silver alone, or copper
plain, or copper and silver lettering can be made
from an elaboration of these designs. College
students delight in copper fobs with silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
lettering, symbols of their fraternities, or figures
representing their class year. The white of the
silver and red brown of the copper blend very
well together. The
fobs may be set with
a single stone, or a
number of stones,
and, again, symbols
may be sawed out of
the silver sheet.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_206.jpg" width="350" height="341" alt="Fobs" />
</div>

<p><i>Material:</i> Silver,
No. 16 gauge. Copper,
No. 14 gauge.
The size of the piece of metal depends upon the
size you wish to make the fob.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Solder, rivets, shears, drill press and drills,
saw frame and saw.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> After deciding upon the design, draw
it on paper and cut it out. Paste this pattern on
the silver sheet and cut out along the outline. If
there is any cut out work to be done, drill the holes
and saw the design out. If you are making a silver
fob and you wish to enrich it by setting stones,
decide upon your stone, make a bezel out of No.
24 silver, and proceed to set the stone as you did in
the ring. If the background is copper with silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
initials riveted upon it, saw out the slot for the strap
to go through, and polish the surface free from all
scratches and lines. File the slot round so it will
not cut the leather strap. Polish by tearing a
little narrow strip of emery cloth the length of the
sheet and pushing it through the slot backward and
forward, pressing down on the top and bottom of
the slot. This tends to round it and to polish out
the file marks. Mark the initials on the silver and
saw them out. Be sure that the stems of the letters
are wide enough to allow holes for riveting. Put
only enough rivets in to hold the letters in place.
Two are usually enough, except with the letters
V and W. The more carefully you follow the lines
of the letters, the less filing you will have to do later.
However, even with the greatest care some filing
must be done and since these letters are the principal
part of the decoration, they should be filed square,
smooth, and a little rounding on the edges of the
face side. Keep the side to be riveted against the
plate flat, so it will fit snugly when fastened.</p>

<p>When the holes have been drilled in the letters,
place them on the copper plate in the proper position
and scratch through one hole with a sharp instrument.
Drill a hole through this point the same size
as the holes in the letters. Rivet these on with silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
rivets. Square the letters up on the plate, drill the
remaining holes, and rivet. If the rivet is driven
down good and snug the end of the rivet can be
filed flush with the top of the silver. If one should
wish to use rivets for decorative purposes they should
be arranged in a definite way. While riveting the
ends be careful to round them up instead of making
them flush.</p>

5 &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. Individual napkin
rings may be made either of silver or
copper. Most rings are made of the silver, but
copper lends itself very well for them. The
design may be pierced, or etched out with acid.
But the design work should always be done while
the metal is in a straight piece. All napkin rings
are made in this way.</p>

<h4>CUFF LINKS</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_210a.jpg" width="600" height="201" alt="Cuff links" />
</div>

<p>Cuff links may be made of gold, silver, copper,
or brass. Often the design is worked out in the
metal alone, again engraving is added, or enamel
or stones. The designs given here are merely suggestions.
Any one of them works out well in the
metal. You will notice that some have a ball on one
end of the link and a plate on the other, while some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
have the double plates. Again, some are made with
loose links joining the two heads. The link is
loosened and pushed through the hole in the cuff
and then hooked on to the plate. One must be
careful to make the plates on a pair of cuff links
small enough to go through the buttonhole of a
cuff.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> For plain oval pair of cuff links. Two
pieces of No. 20 silver, <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. Two pieces of
silver wire, No. 14, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Mark the design by drawing an oval
on the two plates of silver. Keep length and diameter
of both the same. Clip off the sides and shape
to design. Save the small pieces of silver clipped
off, as they will be used to make the balls at the
other end of the cuff link. With the file, bevel the
edge and smooth all down. Place the plates on
a wooden block and curve them a little. Take the
scraps of silver you cut from the plates, place
them in two separate groups on a piece of charcoal,
and heat it until they melt. When the pieces melt
they form themselves into balls. When these silver
balls are cool enough to handle with a pair of pincers,
cool them off in water. File away any part
of the ball a little flat and solder the silver rod
to the ball. Solder the other end of the silver rod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to the curved side of the oval piece. Bend the
connecting rod, like the picture. This forms the
link. Do the same with the other link. Then
file, polish, and finish. If stones are to be set, the
bezels are made and put on the flat plates and
soldered on at the same time the plate is soldered
to the link. The stone is placed in position after
it is all finished.</p>

<p>With a sharp tool draw lines from these holes
to the outer edge.
Be careful to have
all the lines running
parallel to each
other. Place the saw
through the holes and saw the divisions out, keeping
as close to the line as possible. When they are all
sawed out, file each tooth separately, rounding
each one a little. Do this filing most carefully,
for the least roughness left will pull the hair when
the comb is put in place. The extreme point of
each tooth should be sharp, after a gradual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
taper from about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> the length of the tooth to the
end. This can all be done with a file. The comb
is now ready to bend in shape. Place it on the
round stake and with a hammer curve it until
it forms an arc of a 5-in. circle. Most combs are
curved to that degree.</p>

<p><i>Stones:</i> Cut strips of silver for the bezels, long
enough to fit exactly around the stone. Set the
stones on the same way as you did those for rings
and pins. Polish and finish.</p>

ENAMELLING</small></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Enamel</span> is a glass fused to the surface of
metals, for decorative purposes. It is
bought in flat discs about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. thick and
weighing from 5 to 6 ounces. These discs are broken
up so that one is able to buy enamel in small quantities.
It comes in any colour and when put upon the
surface correctly the colour does not change and it is
not affected afterward by atmospheric influences.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> One needs few tools for this work. A
wooden mallet, a mortar and pestle, and a small
spoon used to put the enamel on the metal when
filling the design will be found sufficient. The
spoon may be made by taking a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. piece of silver
or copper wire with about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. of the end flattened
down spoon shaped. File this end round and smooth
so there will be no ragged edges.</p>

<p><i>Process:</i> When you have decided upon the colour
which you wish, put as much enamel as you will
need into the mortar and cover it with clear water.
The water washes the enamel and prevents it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
from flying out as it is broken up. Place the pestle
on the pieces of enamel and tap gently upon the
end of the pestle with the wooden mallet, till the
enamel is broken up into fine pieces. While doing
this the water will become discoloured. Drain the
water off and pour fresh water on. Repeat this so
long as the water becomes discoloured. With the
pestle grind the enamel to a fine paste. Press
down upon the pestle, at the same time give it a
twisting movement with the wrist. When the
water remains clear and the enamel is pasty and
free from lumps it is ready for use. While using
it keep it just covered with clear water. This prevents
its drying and in this dampened state it is in
the best working condition.</p>

<p><i>How to place the enamel on the metal:</i> With the small
spoon pick the enamel up out of the mortar, place
it on the metal and press it down into any depression.
Keep it well moistened all the time. Repeat this
until the whole depression is covered. If any part
is left uncovered, that part will show black after
firing. Then each black spot must be scraped clean,
covered with enamel again and refired, which makes
much unnecessary work, so be careful at the first
to place the enamel just where it should be on the
metal, and so avoid the extra work and firing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
<i>The muffle furnace:</i> This is a small furnace
made for the purpose of melting enamels by what is
called a reflected heat. The muffle is a half rounded,
shaped clay form open only at one end, into which
the piece to be fired is put. The flame of the furnace
plays on the outside of this muffle. The temperature
is raised to the required heat and the piece inside
the muffle is fired without having any flame
playing directly upon it. The reflected heat does the
work. These furnaces can be bought in almost any
general supply store. They come in all sizes. Natural
or artificial gas can be used for heating; the regular
hose or tube attachment is all that is necessary.</p>

<p><i>The piece in place for firing:</i> It is usually best to
light the oven before you begin to place the enamel on
the work to be fired. The furnace heats up in the
meantime. Place the piece on the top ledge of the
furnace close to the chimney. This is a good place to
dry the moisture out of the enamel. If this is not done
the steam generated by the moisture and the heat
causes explosions, which in turn disturb the enamel
surface and dislodge small particles of the enamel.
When the steam has stopped rising from the enamel&mdash;which
you can tell by holding the piece between
you and the light&mdash;the moisture has dried out and
the work can be put into the muffle by use of a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
pair of muffle tongs. Extreme care must be taken
when placing the piece to be fired into the furnace.
The enamel is now very dry. The particles are no
longer held together by the moisture and the least
jar will dislodge them. The doors of the furnace
are usually in two pieces, so that the upper half can
be lifted away from time to time. One can look
in and watch the process of melting. When the
enamel is first put into the furnace and the heat
begins to melt it, it rapidly changes colour. As
it begins to melt it settles down and takes on a
glassy, soft, smooth surface. At this point it is
ready to take out. It is placed again on the top
of this furnace, where it cools off slowly, otherwise
the difference in expansion between the metal and
the glass would cause the surface to crack. After
one or two trials one easily recognizes the critical
time when the enamel is well baked. These directions
are only for enamelling flat surfaces. If
one should wish to enamel both the inside and outside
of a box lid rounded on the top and curved on
the under side, a few large drops of gum arabic
should be mixed with the enamel used for the
under side. This prevents it from dropping off
when in position for firing.</p>

<p>When the work has cooled off so that it can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
handled, it will show a surface every part of which
is covered, if carefully done. If not the black spots
will appear. These are copper spots oxidized by
the heat, and must be thoroughly scrubbed and
scraped. The enamel edges around these spots
must be scraped away, covered with enamel, and refired.
If there are no spots shown, the work is ready
for finishing. You will find on the upper edge of the
enamel line a black line caused by the impurities in
the enamel which rise to the top edge. Scrape this
off with a fine file until it entirely disappears.</p>

<p>The copper, too, usually takes on beautiful
colours during the heating process. Many like
to leave the colours just as they happen to come by
the heat, others prefer to polish the surface to bring
out the real copper colours rather than the oxide
colours. To clean the oxide off one must put the
piece into a pickling bath made up of one part of
sulphuric acid to eight parts of water. This softens
the scum on the surface of the metal so that a soft
rag dipped into any cleaning material like pumice
stone will easily clean it off.</p>


<h4>TWO METHODS OF ENAMELLING</h4>

<p><i>Cloisonn&eacute;:</i> In this work the design is done usually
in coloured enamels, which are separated one from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
another by means of ribs of metal bent so as to
follow the outlines of the design. These ribs are
placed on the plaque, and a drop of solder here and
there keeps them in place. The coloured enamels
are filled in between these ribs and fired as before
explained.</p>

<p><i>Champlev&eacute;:</i> In this method the partitions between
one colour and another are formed by ridges of the
base and not by separated ribs of metal. These
ridges are made by driving the metal with chasing
tools from the under side up and raising it above
the surface. The spaces between these walls are
filled in with enamel, and it is all fired as explained
before.</p>

<p>The lid on the rose jar as shown in the group is
an example of this kind of enamelling.</p>


<h4>IMITATION PATINA (GREEN TINT ON COPPER)</h4>

<p>The best method of obtaining a coating resembling
patina is to immerse the article in a solution
of nitrate of copper, and then to place it while still
wet in a chamber containing an abundance of carbolic
acid. In this case the development of the
green incrustation may be observed from day to
day. If after a week the object has not yet obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the proper colour, it must be again dipped
in the above solution, and this operation is repeated
till the desired shade has been acquired. As the
formation of this green colour proceeds in the same
way as in the open air, but more rapidly, a handsome
and permanent coating of green can be produced
by this means.</p>


<h4>CHEMICAL METAL COLOURING</h4>

<p><i>How to put a thin coating of colouring on the surface
of metals by chemicals:</i> A great variety of
shades may be obtained simply through heat. The
colours ordinarily produced on copper articles by
means of heat come through the polishing. Any
metal whose surface is highly polished will take on
a number of different colours, beginning at a straw
colour and changing to a dark straw, purple, dark
blue, light blue, and steel or gray, by heating
the piece to be coloured to a temperature of
630&deg; F.</p>

<p><i>Barium sulphide and water (a very good composition
for colouring metal):</i> Immerse object until it
assumes desired tint from light brown to violet to
black. Heat gently over bunsen flame until a
rich deep violet appears. After it is cool rub with
soft cloth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Patina imitation (a very good composition for the
greening of copper):</i></p>


<ul>
<li> 1 part sal. ammoniac,</li>
<li> 3 parts cream tartar,</li>
<li> 6 parts salt,</li>
<li>12 parts hot water,</li>
<li> 2 parts nitrate of copper.</li>
</ul>


<p>Saturate soft cloth and rub or sprinkle the solution
on the copper. Let stand in the open air ten
or twelve hours. Wash the colour off with clear
cold water. Tone down to suit.</p>

<p>Another way of colouring metal.</p>

<p>Silver.</p>

<p><i>To oxidize silver:</i> The following is a solution commonly
used for oxidizing silver:</p>


<ul><li>Potassium sulphide, 5 grains,</li>
<li>Water, 10 fluid ounces.</li>
</ul>


<p>The variety known as liver or sulphur is generally
used, and imparts a reddish brown colour to the
silver, the colour being darker the darker the solution.
It should be worked at 60 or 70 per cent.
The stronger the solution the blacker the colour.
If ammonium carbonate (20 grains) is added to the
above formula and is worked hot, a black colour
appears upon rubbing with a very fine wire brush.
It takes on the colour of black lead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
<i>Colouring of brass:</i></p>


<ul><li>Copper sulphate, 2 ounces;</li>
<li>Water, just sufficient to dissolve the copper sulphate;</li>
<li>Ammonia, to neutralize and make slightly alkaline.</li>
</ul>


<p>This will turn brass a very beautiful blue-black
colour. Copper assumes a very beautiful tint from
this solution.</p>

<p><i>Cement for engravers:</i> Melt best pitch in an iron
pot and when completely liquid stir in a mixture
composed of two thirds of raw pitch and one third
plaster of paris. Make a lot of ten pounds. Add
one half pound mutton tallow, boil and mix
thoroughly. Should this be too soft, add plaster
of paris until you get the desired hardness:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 lbs. black raw pitch,</li>
<li>5 lbs. plaster of paris,</li>
<li>1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> lbs. mutton tallow.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>To polish enamel:</i> After rubbing it down with the
corundum file, take a small rod of tin or pewter and
after anointing it with fine Tripoli or rotten-stone,
grind the surface of the enamel evenly with the tin
or pewter rod. Next take a stick of lime wood and
use that with the rotten-stone in the same way and
finish with putty powder and stick covered with
chamois skin.</p>

<p><i>To unsolder a piece of work:</i> Paint those joints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
which are not to be unsoldered with a mixture of
clay water, to which add a little common salt.
When dry, scrape the part to be unsoldered and paint
it with borax. Now heat till solder melts, pick
off with pliers or knock it off with a gentle tap.
The borax adds flux, thus helping the solder to run
at a melting temperature.</p>


<h4>MACHINERY IN METAL WORK: DIE MAKING</h4>

<p>Most of the jewellery that we see nowadays
and also much of the metal work is made under
presses or drop hammers. As was shown in the
making of the mould for the round copper tray,
the skill lies in the making of the design and the
making of a mould to fit the design.</p>

<p>The description of the making of a match safe by
means of die sinking will explain how all die work
is done: The design for the match safe is made
by the artist, who turns it over to the die sinker.
He, in turn, chisels out of a steel block, about 7 ins.
square, a depression in which the design fits. If
the match safe has an embossed design, this is all
chiselled out carefully with small chisels and filed
up smoothly so that when a piece of soft lead is
driven into the depression it will take the shape of
the match safe as designed by the artist. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
lead is so soft that it takes the print readily. This
lead reproduction shows to the die sinker any imperfection
in the die. The imperfections, if there
are any, are smoothed down. The driving in of
the lead into the depression is repeated from time
to time, until the mould is the exact reproduction
of the artist's design.</p>

<p>The die is now hardened by heating it red hot
and cooling in water. When taken out of the
water it is placed in the hammer or press. On the
ram of the hammer is keyed, directly above this
die, a square block of lead. When the hammer
falls, the impact of the lead upon the impression
produces a reproduction of the impression.
This lead piece makes the top die. A piece
of thin silver is placed in the steel die over the
impression. If the ram is now dropped upon the
silver plate it will force the plate into the impression
and will stamp the design on the silver. One
half of the match box is made in this way. When
two of these are made, put together, and soldered,
they make a whole match box. Thousands of match
boxes would be made from this one die. That is the
reason why this class of work can be sold so cheaply.</p>

<p>The principle explained here is used for the
making of tea sets, dinner sets, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
The same thing is true of the round wood mould
you made to make the copper tray in. It can be
used to make dozens of trays, all the same size and
shape.</p>

BLACKSMITHING AND TOOLS</small></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Let's</span> go to the blacksmith's shop and tell
the blacksmith what we have done. You
see I've shown you all he taught me about
copper, brass, and silver. I promised to take you
there when we got through. Come on. Here we
are! This is his shop. Mr. Blacksmith, this is
my friend. I've shown him how to do work in metal
and he can do all that you taught me. We both
want to learn how to make things out of steel and
iron. Are you ready to take us on?</p>

<p>Yes, boys, you are just in time to help me out.
And while you are lending a hand I can show you
how to make many things that every boy can learn
to do with iron and steel. Come into the shop.
First I'll tell you about the blacksmith shop equipment.
This is my forge and bellows, with the coal
heap at the side; here is the anvil and here are my
tools. You see it doesn't take a blacksmith long to
name the things he needs to equip his shop. But
you must know how each thing is used and what it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
used for. Let me draw you a picture of the forge
on this board and explain to you how it is built.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_236.jpg" width="600" height="474" alt="Forge" />
</div>

<p><i>A</i> is the chimney. You see it has an opening in
the bottom to let the smoke go up. <i>B</i> is a leather
bellows. It is placed back of the chimney out of
the way of sparks from the forge fire. The nozzle
of the bellows goes through a hole ending on the
hearth of the forge. <i>C</i> is the hearth where the coal
is placed. <i>D</i> is a nest in the centre of the hearth,
called a tuyere. Through this opening the blast
from the bellows enters the coal heap.</p>

<p>The whole forge is built of brick and mortar.
Modern forges are made of iron and steel and have
a sheet iron hood in place of a brick chimney. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the principle of the tuyere, where the blast enters
the forge, is the same as we blacksmiths have always
used. Now I'll build the fire in the forge. Here
in this box are some shavings. I save all my shavings
and put them here to start my fire with. Place the
shavings over the tuyere and light them. Let them
burn for a little while, then cover the whole with
this soft bituminous coal. This kind of coal is free
from sulphur and phosphorus, and it cokes very
nicely when the gas and tar are burnt out. Now
it's time to use the bellows. You can take hold of
this handle and pull down. The weights on the
bottom pull the handle up again. Sometimes weights
are placed on the top board. This helps to increase
the air pressure. Notice that the bellows hang
in a frame and the centre axis is fastened to the
upright, allowing the upper and lower half to rise
and fall. When the lower half falls it sucks the air
in through a little trap door on the bottom, and
when raised the trap door closes and the air is forced
through the nozzle into the tuyere on the forge.
This alternates, first taking the air in and then
forcing the air out. Pump gently at first, then the
coal will not smother the fire. That volume of
smoke coming up is mostly from the burning shavings
and it goes right up the flue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
This blue flame that you see now shows that the
gases are burning in the coal. When they are burnt
out the coals give a red glow. Now the bright fire
is shown through the coal. Put your poker into
the coal heap and raise it gently. The opening
made on the top is a vent for the heat to escape and
prevents the fire blowing into the shop. An opening
like this should always be left at the top, on account
of the oxygen which is being pumped in constantly.
Sprinkle a little water on the coal around the outside
of the fire. This helps to pack the coal down tight
and keep the fire in a confined space, for it is apt to
spread and use up much more coal than is needed.</p>

<p>You see, boys, this is an old-fashioned blacksmith
shop. Most of the work done here is horseshoeing,
though we have many complex things brought in
for us to repair, none of which can be turned away.
All these shoes hanging on the rafters are for horses
and mules. The mule's shoe, you see, is a different
shape from the horse's shoe. I make these in my
spare moments and we call them stock shoes. Notice
that the stock shoes have no heels or toes on them.
These are put on when the shoe is made to fit the
horse's foot.</p>

<p>Shoes are now made by machinery and I buy them
when I haven't time to make them. But they, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
must be fitted to the foot, for they come only in stock
form.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to show you how to make a horseshoe.
I'll make it out of this piece of steel tire from
a wagon wheel. We use all this kind of scrap to
make the stock shoes. That's why our made shoes
can be sold cheaper than the manufactured shoes,
if we have the time to make them. Steel is being
used in place of iron in all branches of industry.
A steel shoe weighing half a pound will wear as
long as an iron shoe weighing one pound.</p>

<p>This piece of steel tire which I am using is 1 in.
wide and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. thick. I want to keep the thickness
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in., but reduce the width to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. To do this
the end of the piece of metal is put into the forge
fire. As soon as it is hot enough, I take it out and
place it, edge up, on the anvil, and with the hand
hammer draw it out any length I wish. You
see that driving down on the edge of the hot
bar thickens it. Now turn it over and drive on the
flat side. You must keep driving first on the edge
and then on the side until it is the right size. This
is called stretching the metal out. Now the bar
is long enough to bend in the shape of a letter U.
Heat about 6 ins. of this bar and then place it on the
largest part of the anvil horn. Strike on the projecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
end with a hand hammer. It bends easily
into the shape.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_241.jpg" width="500" height="140" alt="Front piece" />
</div>

<p>Take the chisel-shaped tool. The edge of this tool
makes the groove to fit the nail heads. Every horseshoe
has eight rectangular holes for nails, four on each
side. These are punched through with this punch,
and are made just large enough to fit the horseshoe
nail heads. Now you see a stock shoe, and it is just
like the dozens I have hanging on the rafters. But
before the shoe is placed on the horse's foot it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
have the front piece, called the toe calk, welded
on and the ends of the shoe turned up for heels.
To make the toe calk I take a piece of iron or steel
about 2 &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. The end of this piece is
prepared like this:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_241a.jpg" width="500" height="169" alt="Prepared like this" />
</div>

<p>The little projection is made very sharp so that it
can stick into the hot iron. In this way it is kept
in place during the process of welding. When the
calk is made I heat the shoe and place the calk
in the proper position. The calk is cold and the
little projecting point is easily driven into the hot
iron. Now that it is held in place it must be welded
on. Iron and steel are welded together only by the
use of a flux. There are many kinds of fluxes used.
For this I shall use <i>borax</i>. I buy it by the pound and
it comes in boxes like this. Sprinkle a little on the
calk, heat it in the fire, watch the fire. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
metal is hot enough to weld you will notice a brown
smoke coming from the fire. That tells you the borax
is burning. There, see the smoke! Now I must take
the shoe out quickly and place it on the anvil. A few
quick, light blows upon the calk and the welding is
done! The hammering must be done quickly after the
shoe has been taken out of the fire, or the cold air
will lower the temperature and prevent the metal
from uniting. There, it's welded! Now I shape it
and fit it to the horse's foot. The heels can't be
bent up until I know just how long the horse's
foot is. I measure by placing it on the hoof. Then
the two ends of the shoe are bent and driven down
so that the height of the heels equals the height
of the calk. Now, boys, this is a hand made
shoe. When you know how to use the fire
and the tools it is an easy problem to make a
horseshoe.</p>

<p>So it is with all blacksmiths' work. There is
not anything about it you can't do. Any boy
can build his own blacksmith shop if he has a shed
or shelter large enough to keep the rain from a forge,
anvil, and some tools. You needn't have the big,
old-fashioned brick forge like mine. Here is a picture
of a portable forge that I can recommend. It can
be bought at almost any store that deals in hardware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
supplies. It is small and handy and can be easily
taken from place to place. You can buy any size
anvil you wish. They come in all sizes, weighing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
from five pounds to five hundred pounds. Here is
a list of tools which will do all the work, both ornamental
and plain, which you may wish to do. Get
this equipment, then build your shop.</p>


<h4>BLACKSMITHS' TOOLS</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width:250px;">
<img src="images/i_244.jpg" width="250" height="154" alt="Hand hammer" />
</div>

<p>Some of these tools you have used in your copper,
brass, and silver work. You will need your vise,
files, your various punches, dividers, hand cold
chisel, and square. In addition, you should have the
following:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<img src="images/i_246.jpg" width="300" height="466" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Hot chisel. Cold chisel</div>
</div>

<p><i>Hand hammer:</i> A hand
hammer is used more than
any other tool in the shop.
The flat face is used for shaping
material and the round plain for riveting, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
The top and bottom fullers are used for making
depressions in iron and steel. This process is called
fullering. The top and bottom swages are used for
rounding square iron or steel or reducing large sizes
to smaller ones. Hot and cold chisels are both used
for cutting iron. As the name shows, one is used
for hot iron and one for cold iron. Gouges are for
cutting ornamental shapes on sheet iron or steel, hot
or cold. Calipers are used for measuring diameters.
The broad flat surface of the flatter smoothes rough
places. The set hammer is used to make square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
shoulders. It is a small hammer and does the
work in narrow places which larger tools cannot
reach. This sledge
weighs about eight
pounds. It is used where
heavy hammering or
driving is needed, and
in conjunction with such
tools as swages, fullers,
set hammers, etc. The
hardie is a sharp cutting
tool used to cut small
pieces of iron and soft
steel while hot or cold.
Tongs are of all sizes.
Those most called into
use have the following
shapes: The shovel for
the fire must be small
and strong so the clinker
formed on the bottom
can be shoveled out without
carrying too much
coal with it. A poker,
rake, and dipper also are needed
for use about the fire.</p>

<p>The smoke is the most troublesome
thing in a blacksmith's shop.
The old-fashioned forge is perhaps
the best made to draw the gases and smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
out, except when exhaust fans are used for that
purpose. Hoods are fitted to pull down over the
fire, completely covering the smoke area, and the
suction made by the fan will draw all the smoke
from the fire. This, of course, is possible only in
modern equipped shops. The portable forges that
we use have none of this drawing-out system, except
through a natural draft chimney, made either of
bricks or by extending an iron pipe from the hood
through the side of the shed or through the roof.
The down-draft system is a hood placed to one side
of the fire. It falls over the fire by means of a hinge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
placed on the hood. This is not as effective as the
overhead system on account of the smallness of
the hood. The pipes are all underground,
otherwise the system is
the same as the overhead system.</p>

<p><i>Danger of explosion:</i> Coal
gases leak into the tuyere when
the blast is shut off. When the
blast is put on these gases are
blown up into the hot fire and they
explode from the heat. They do
no harm, except the noise made
by the explosion.</p>

<p><i>Fuels:</i> The coal used in a blacksmiths' shop is a
soft coal called bituminous coal. It is supposed to
have less phosphorus and sulphur than any other
kind of coal. Coal containing either of these ingredients
should not be used. Sulphur makes iron
hot short and phosphorus makes the iron cold
short that is, the iron is made brittle while hot by
means of the sulphur, and brittle when cold through
the effect of the phosphorus. When this soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
coal is heated the coal tar is burned out and the
coal burns into a coke.</p>

<p><i>Charcoal:</i> Charcoal is a solid fuel and the very best
fuel for heating purposes. It is free from the impurities
mentioned here. It is made by burning hard wood in
a closed oven or kiln. This kiln in turn burns the
wood into lumps of charcoal. The cost makes the
only real objection to the use of charcoal as fuel.</p>


<h4>PIG IRON</h4>

<p>Iron ore is an oxide of iron containing from 35 per
cent. to 65 per cent. iron. The rest is oxygen, phosphorus,
sulphur, silica, and other impurities. Iron
ore is charged into a blast furnace, mixed with limestone
as a flux, and melted down, with coke as
fuel. The metal which results from this melting
is known as commercial pig iron.</p>


<h4>WROUGHT IRON</h4>

<p>Wrought iron is made from pig iron. The pig
iron is remelted in a so-called puddling furnace by
charging about half a ton at one time into the furnace.
While in a molten state it is stirred up with
large iron hooks by the puddler. It is kept boiling
so as to expose every part of the iron bath to the
action of the flame in order to burn out the carbon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
The other impurities will separate from the iron and
run out of the furnace as slag.</p>

<p>The temperature in the puddling furnace is high
enough to melt pig iron but not high enough to keep
wrought iron in a liquid state. So, as soon as the
small particles of iron become purified the partially
congealed portion forms a spongy mass, in which
small globules of iron ore are in a semi-plastic state.
These are gathered up by the puddler and his helper
and are formed into a ball on the bottom of the furnace
by means of long rabble bars used for this purpose.
The ball is about 150 to 200 pounds in weight.
These lumps of iron are taken to a large hammer or
squeezer.</p>

<p>There they are shaped into long blooms to fit
the rolls. They are taken right from the squeezer
to the rolling mill and rolled out into bars 4 ins. or
5 ins. wide and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. thick. These bars are called
muck bars owing to their spongy-like appearance
and the large quantity of cinders which they contain.
The muck bars are now cut into lengths of
3 ft. and 4 ft. and are piled on top of each other
in blocks of 200 lbs. The blocks are put into a
heating furnace and heated to a welding heat.
While at this heat they are put through the rolls,
thus welding the whole mass together, at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
time reducing the pile to sizes required by the
market. When cold these are cut into lengths for
use. This is the iron used in most blacksmiths'
shops.</p>

FIRST PROBLEMS IN FORGING</small></h3>


<h4>HOW TO MAKE A STAKE PIN</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Stake</span> pins are used for holding ropes in
place, such as those on tents, etc.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. round &times; 18 ins. long of
wrought iron.</p>

<p><i>Tool:</i> Hand hammer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_253.jpg" width="600" height="93" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Stake Pin</div>
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> This sketch is made full size and it
shows a round stake pin with a four-sided tapering
end about 3 ins. long. Place one end of the bar of
iron into the fire. It should be placed so that the
iron will be parallel to the bottom of the hearth.</p>

<p>All the heating done for this kind of work must be
done in a reducing fire. There are two kinds of
fires, the oxidizing fire and the reducing fire. The
oxidizing fire is one where the quantity of air blown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in is not all consumed by the fire. There is an excess
of air and an oxide is formed on the iron. This
prevents it from heating sufficiently. The reducing
fire is one where the blast is in proportion to the
consuming power of the fire&mdash;that is, just enough
air is blown in to be used up by the fire.</p>

<p>The greater the temperature the more coal and
likewise the more blast required. So that a temperature
of 2500&deg; Fahrenheit can be easily gotten on an
ordinary forge fire. While the iron is heating it
should be drawn out of the forge fire once in a while
to be examined. When it has reached a white
heat, not sparkling, place it on the anvil, and with
a hand hammer begin at the end and drive it into
shape according to your sketch. Hammer this until
the iron begins to darken. Place it again in the fire
and repeat as before until the thing is finished. A
piece of iron may be heated a dozen times while
working it into shape. All depends upon the skill
and experience of the worker.</p>

<p>You will probably learn in this problem that
metal will burn in this high temperature the same
as a piece of wood and very much quicker. It
does not smoulder like wood; it just melts away.
It would be well to have the point of the iron stake
melt or burn off in this particular case so that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
can learn all about the heating, melting, and burning
of iron. The fine point on the stake is made by
keeping the metal on the extreme outer edge of the
anvil, so that the outer half of the hammer face
will project over the anvil edge, thus reducing any
metal between the two into a very small space.
(See <a href="#i_275a">position of hand hammer</a> in the article on tools.)</p>

<p>When the work is finished the temperature of
the metal should be low. This prevents the metal
from scaling and gives an opportunity for a smooth
finished surface.</p>

<h4>HOW TO MAKE A STAPLE</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_255.jpg" width="600" height="444" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Staple</div>
</div>

<p>Staples are small U-shaped pieces of iron with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
pointed ends. They are driven into wood for the
purpose of holding some attachment in place. We
have staples for barn doors, to catch the gate hook,
to fasten chains, etc.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> One piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. round iron 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
ins. long.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Heat one end of the iron piece.
Draw it to a square point as was done on the staple
pin. Flatten this point as shown in the drawing.
Cut it off square at the extreme end so that it will
be quite sharp when finished. Repeat on the other
end. The piece will now be about 6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. long,
about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. round in the middle, with square, tapering
points. The centre is now heated and the piece
is bent over the horn of the anvil to the shape shown
in the drawing.</p>

<p>In bending this over the horn of the anvil strike
with light blows so that the two ends will be the same
length. If it is warped or twisted, flatten it out
again on the anvil till the flat sides lie in the same
plane.</p>


<h4>GATE HOOK</h4>

<p>This hook is used for fastening doors as well as
gates. The drawing shows a gate hook twisted
in the middle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
<i>Material:</i> One piece of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. square iron about
6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. long.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_257.jpg" width="600" height="253" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Gate hook</div>
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Mark off with the centre punch 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>
ins. on one end and 1<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> ins. on the other. Put the
short end into the fire and draw it out until it is
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. square. Hammer the corners down, thus
rounding the end until it measures <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter
and is about 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> ins. long.</p>

<p>Repeat on the large end and draw this out until
it measures 2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. long. Bend the end as shown
by the drawing. When both ends are bent in shape
put the piece into the fire and heat it red hot between
the eye and the hook. Place it in the jaws
of the vise about 1 in. from the eye, and with a pair
of tongs and a wrench grasp the piece about 1 in.
from the hook and give it one complete turn. This
twists the hook in the centre like the drawing. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
it has become bent while twisting it may be straightened
by hammering it between two blocks of hard
wood. This prevents bruising the sharp edges of
the twist.</p>

<h4>HARNESS HOOK</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_258.jpg" width="600" height="451" alt="Harness hook" />
</div>

<p>These large hooks are most useful around a stable
and are used to hold harness, bags, etc.; in short,
they are general utility hooks. They are simply and
quickly made.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> Stock <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 6 ins. long round iron.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Flatten the iron down by heating
it red hot. With the hand hammer flatten out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
one end 4 ins. long, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. wide &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. thick. One
inch from the shoulder made by the flattening
begin to draw out the end to a round straight taper,
3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. long. Bend the flat part over the flat end
of the anvil, to fit a joint or any wooden beam (as
shown by the sketch), and hook it over the horn.</p>

<p>This hook may be made any size according to the
purpose for which it is to be used.</p>


<h4>TWO-PRONGED FORK</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_259.jpg" width="600" height="340" alt="Two pronged fork" />
</div>

<p>This two-pronged fork is found useful for pitching
hay, fishing, etc.</p>

<p><i>Stock:</i> <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 1 &times; 5 ins. long, soft steel.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Two inches back from the end of
the bar punch a small hole in the middle of the iron.
(See method of punching). Split the piece with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the chisel up to this hole. Open the part split and
spread at right angles to the shank. Heat the piece
up at the crotch. With a fuller, fuller down to
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. back of the spread arms. Draw the stem out
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. round. Now the fork is blocked out ready
for finishing. This is done by following the drawings
for the dimensions and size. Notice that the
two ends of the fork are drawn out to a sharp round
taper. The stem is drawn out to a sharp square
taper, which is to be driven into a wood
handle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_260.jpg" width="600" height="267" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fish spear</div>
</div>

<p><i>Fish spear:</i> If this two-pronged fork is meant for
a fish spear, used so often in rivers where the current
is very swift, the extreme ends are flattened down
to a spear point as shown in the drawing.</p>


<h4>BOLTS</h4>

<p>A bolt consists of a stem and a head. Bolt heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
are of all shapes&mdash;square, hexagonal, round, flat,
etc.&mdash;while the stem is always round. As a rule,
the thickness of the head equals the thickness of
the stem, and the diameter of the head is about 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
times the thickness of the stem. This proportion
is generally kept for square and hexagonal bolts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_261.jpg" width="600" height="168" alt="Bolt" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_261a.jpg" width="600" height="191" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Bolt</div>
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Out of the piece of iron used enough
of the end is upset to make the head. To do this,
heat 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. from the end of the bar to a bright red
heat. Take the piece out of the fire, place the hot end
on the anvil, and with the bar in a vertical position
hammer upon the cold end. The cold end is driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
into the hot end, thus shortening or upsetting the
bar. This is repeated. The end is heated again
and the hammering is continued until the enlarged
end has the right proportion for the head of the
bolt. (See <a href="#i_262">drawing</a>.) Heat the enlarged end again
and pass the cold end of the stem through the heading
tool. Place the heading tool upon the anvil
in such a position that the stem passes through the
hole in the anvil. The upset end is hammered down
against the heading tool until the head is the required
thickness. Take it off the heading tool
and square it up with the hand hammer. If, after
squaring up, the head is found to be too small in
diameter and too thick, it is again put into the heading
tool and hammered down. This is repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
until the head is finished according to the drawing
shown.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="i_262"></a><img src="images/i_262.jpg" width="600" height="279" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Bolt in heading tool</div>
</div>

<p>All hand-made bolts are made on this principle,
whether they are very large or very small.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_263.jpg" width="200" height="139" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Collar</div>
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_263a.jpg" width="300" height="158" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Bolt heads</div>
</div>

<p>If a six-sided bolt is desired the same method is
used. The head is made six-sided instead of being
squared as was done in the first case. The bolt is
finally cut to the required length and the end is
bevelled off ready for threading. Bolts may be made
without going through the process of upsetting the
stock. In that case the bars used are of any diameter,
depending upon the size of the stem needed.
Bend a piece of iron for a collar to give you the
amount of stock required for the bolt head. Heat
the end of the iron bar. Put this hot end into the
collar. Upset it so that it fills the space in the
collar. Put it into the fire, then weld and finish as
you did in making the head with the end upset.</p>

<p>All bolts that are on the market except special
bolts are made by bolt heading machines. Up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. in diameter all bolts are made without
the use of heat. Those above that size are all
heated red hot and the principle is exactly the same
as you used when you made the bolt by hand. The
machine upsets the head and at the same time shapes
it into any desired shape.</p>


<h4>NUTS</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_264.jpg" width="350" height="283" alt="Nuts" />
</div>

<p>Nuts are used in conjunction with bolts for
fastening things together or tightening up parts of
machines. There
are two ways of
making nuts; one is
to cut a piece of
metal off the right
length, punch a hole
in the middle, and
finish it by shaping
it on the end of a
mandrel or punch. The second way is to weld a
collar and shape this on a mandrel. Though the
second method involves welding and is the more
difficult of the two, it is the better method. However,
the grain of the metal in the second method
runs around the nut, while in the former case it runs
lengthwise. For this reason the nut is apt to split<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
when tightened up too tight on the bolt. The method
explained here is the easier one of the two: it is the
simple process of making the nut by punching the
hole.</p>

<p><i>Material:</i> Stock 1 &times; <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. of wrought iron,
any length.</p>

<p><i>Tools:</i> Hammer, punch, hot chisel, pair of calipers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_265.jpg" width="600" height="198" alt="Making a square nut" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> The drawing here shows each step
in the process of making the square nut. Measure
off 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. on the bar and with the hot chisel nick
on each side almost through. Find the centre of
the piece and, with the punch, punch a hole through
it after heating it red hot. Place it on the anvil.
Place the punch in the centre and drive down from
one side until the impression of the punch shows
through on the other side. Withdraw the punch
and turn the piece upside down. Place the punch
upon the impression shown through, driving down
till the centre piece is loosened. It is now put over
the hole of the anvil and this loosened centre piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
driven out. This leaves a hole in the hot iron.
All holes made in hot iron are punched through
in this way whether they be large or small. The
size of the hole is determined by the size of the
punch.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_266.jpg" width="400" height="268" alt="Square nut" />
</div>

<p>Re-heat the iron, push the punch into the hole
made, and by a bending motion break the piece off
where it is nicked. The piece now is sticking on
to the end of the punch. Place them on the anvil
and square up the nut while the punch is still in the
hole. This prevents the hole from changing its
shape while the nut is being driven into shape.
It is now taken off the punch and flattened down to
the desired thickness.
Repeat this
edging up and
flattening down
till the nut is finished.</p>

<p>Hexagonal nuts
are made in the
same way, except for the squaring up. When the
piece is ready for shaping it is made round while
on the punch and then made six-sided. It is flattened
and edged up in the same manner until the
desired size is reached.</p>

<h3><a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>XXII<br /><br /><small>
WELDING</small></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It is</span> often necessary to join together two pieces
of iron, or the ends of the same piece, as in
forming a circle, so that the joint will form
one solid mass. When this is done the pieces are
said to be welded together. Most of the problems
treated so far have had to do with single pieces of
iron. Often many pieces are welded together to
make one forging, as in making the horseshoe. This
is called built up work.</p>

<p>It is possible to weld any iron surfaces provided
no oxide of iron is formed upon the surface. If
such a coating occurs welding is impossible. Iron
heated in the air absorbs oxygen, which results
in the oxide formation. There are two ways of
guarding against this difficulty: (1) Suitable
fluxes, and (2) reducing fires.</p>

<p>The best flux is a sharp sand, usually beach sand.
This is sprinkled over the ends to be welded. The sand
fuses on to the ends of the iron and excludes the air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
The reducing fire is one that consumes all the
oxygen that is forced into it by the blast. This is
obtained by having a thick bed of fire for the air
to pass through before coming into contact with the
iron and by keeping the blast pressure low enough
to enable the fire to burn all that is admitted.
A thick fire, so to speak, should always be
kept.</p>


<h4>TO MAKE AN IRON RING</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_268.jpg" width="600" height="564" alt="To make an iron ring" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
The simplest problem for a first weld is a flat
iron ring. This drawing shows a ring 3 ins. in
diameter on the inside and 5 ins. on the outside.</p>

<p><i>Stock:</i> Flat piece of iron 13<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 1 &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> ins.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> The making of this ring involves
the processes of bending and welding. Before the
bending is done the two ends are upset and made
about 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. thicker than they were, for about 1 in.
back from either end. To do the upsetting, place
the hot end on the anvil vertically and strike on the
cold end with the hammer until the required thickness
is obtained. If the end which is being upset
was not heated more than 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in., it will probably
upset without bending. If heated more than this
the probabilities are that it will bend during the
process. If it does so, it should be laid upon the
anvil and the bend hammered out. When the
desired thickness has been obtained scarf the ends
as shown in the drawing, using the round end or
peen of the hammer to do so. (See <a href="#i_275a">scarfing</a>.)</p>

<p>Do the same to the other end, putting the scarf
on the opposite side to the first one. Now heat the
piece, about half its length, quite hot. Place it
upon the thickest part of the horn of the anvil,
strike upon the end that projects beyond the anvil,
and bend it into a ring. The scarfs, being opposite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
will now fit and come together. (See <a href="#i_272">drawing</a>.)
Bend over till the two edges lap. This gives plenty
of material where the joint comes, to allow for the
waste of the material from the high welding heat and
also that needed for the hammering of the metal
during the welding. The upsetting is done to
allow for this waste, and to give opportunity to
reduce the pieces to the required thickness. All
welds should be a trifle large at the joint. The
driving down edgewise on the horn of the anvil
bends the material, but prevents one shaping it
to its proper dimensions. That is why in flattening
down the weld care must be taken not to widen
the iron at that place so that it is too thin. A few
trials will make this perfectly clear. A finish on
the iron depends upon how skilfully one can use
the hammer without unduly marking the metal.</p>

<p>Most chains are made by hand, especially those
used for the purpose of lifting heavy loads. Small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
chains, where no special strain is called for, are
welded by electricity. There are special factories
for the making of chains. Most of these factories
have rolling mills attached. The material is here
rolled out to suit the different size chains that are
made. Machinery forms the bars of iron into
special shapes the size of the links. These in turn
are cut by machinery. These links are all of the
same size and are cut off on an angle, thus making
the scarf. They are taken by the workmen, the
ends lapped over slightly, then put into the fire and
welded. Within the last few years the Navy Department
has taken up the method of welding the
large anchor chains by machinery.</p>

<div class="caption">Link ready to weld the end</div>
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> The drawing shows the size of each
link in this chain. Heat the 6-in. piece in the middle.
Place it on the horn of the anvil and bend it U-shaped,
as you did the piece for the staple. (See
<a href="#Page_247">articles in welding</a> for chains.) The two ends are
the same length. This is perhaps the only weld
that is made without upsetting. When the scarfs
are made like the drawing, bend the ends so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
scarfs overlap. Now it is ready for welding. Place
the link in the fire. Be careful to have the link well
covered both above and below
with hot coals. Let there be just
enough blast to increase the heat
of the fire. In a little while the
sparks will flow up from the iron.
At this time the link should be turned upside down
in the fire without changing its position. The
hottest part of the fire being underneath, the
iron will heat there quickest. This turning it
upside down finally brings all the parts to be
welded in the hottest part of the fire. When
these iron sparks begin to show, it is time
to take the piece out. Place it on the anvil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
lightly tap upon the joint. The iron is very soft
on account of the intense heat and if the blows are
too heavy the iron will flatten out until it is too thin.
In that case it would be impossible to finish the
piece and make the weld the size it should be when
done. If you examine the links of any chain you
will have difficulty to find the welded end. The
process of welding is not easy at first, but a few trials
with the heating of the iron and handling the tools
at the critical moment will prove encouraging.
Chains are usually made by making first one link,
then putting the stock for the next link into the first,
before bending the second end.</p>

<p>All hooks, swivels, or shackles are put on the chain
when made, in the same way that you add a link in
order to lengthen the chain.</p>

<p>Welds are named according to the manner in
which the pieces are put together. The principal
welds are: (1) flat welds, (2) butt welds, (3) lap
welds, (4) cleft welds, and (5) jump welds. The
selection of the kind of weld to be used in any problem
depends upon the form of the pieces of metal
to be worked upon.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_274a.jpg" width="400" height="196" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Hammer peen</div>
</div>

<p><i>Flat welds:</i> For flat welds the ends of the pieces
of metal are first
upset. Use the
peen of the hammer
and draw the
metal out thin at
the end, flatten it
out and narrow it
up edgewise at the extreme end. The metal is forced
first forward and backward by the hammer strokes.
Large scarfs are sometimes made by using a fuller.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
This is a very much quicker way for large work than
the one just explained, but one requires a helper
to handle the sledge hammer in this case, to strike
down on the fuller.</p>

<div class="caption">Scarfing on edge of anvil</div>
</div>

<p>Most smiths use the edge of the anvil for making
scarfs. Place the edge of the metal, after it has been
upset, on the edge of the anvil and strike down on the
top with a hammer or sledge. This moves the metal
with each blow and the end of the bar is increased,
making, as it were, a series of steps. It is a process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
much the same as fullering except in place of the
fuller you use the edge of the anvil. This is the
quickest way to make a scarf, and the weld depends
wholly upon how the scarfs are made in any one
of the operations spoken of here.</p>

<p>If the scarf is well made it will be a little higher
in the middle than at the sides, so that when the
pieces are placed together the slag that forms will
squeeze out. The welding is done as follows:
Place the scarfs of both pieces separately in the fire,
the scarfs downward. (When we speak of scarfs
we refer to the bevelled edge of the roughest part of
the scarf.) This prevents any impurities melting
on the scarf surface. When the scarf begins to
get hot enough to weld, iron sparks will blow out
with the blaze. This is the sign to get things in
readiness. One cannot linger for a moment when
the iron is hot enough to weld. See that the anvil
is clean. Have the hammer ready in hand. If
one has a helper he will handle one piece while the
smith handles the hammer and the other piece.</p>

<p>If there is no helper a hammer is placed conveniently
near the anvil. The two pieces of iron are
grasped by the smith, one in either hand, drawn out
of the fire and given a sharp rap on the edge of the
anvil or forge to remove any dirt or pieces of coal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
clinging to the scarfs. One piece is placed on the
anvil and the other piece is put on top of this.
The weight of the second piece holds the first piece
in place until such time as the smith can get his
hammer ready to strike. As soon as the pieces stick
together the ends of the scarfs are welded first.
They are the thinnest and will cool the quickest.
The body of the piece welds while you are welding
the scarfs. Both sides are worked upon, first on
one and then on the other, till the piece is hammered
down to the required size. In trial work it is best
for one to use pieces of iron long enough to avoid
the use of tongs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_277.jpg" width="400" height="94" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Butt welds</div>
</div>

<p><i>Butt welds:</i> If the butt weld is carefully made it
is perhaps the safest weld of all. This method is
used mostly in welding round iron bars, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins.
in diameter up to 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. They are made as
follows: the ends of two bars are heated to a welding
heat. Then they are brought out of the fire, put
in a swage, end to end, and struck on the ends with
a sledge hammer. While driving upon the ends the
iron upsets when the contact takes place and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the same time the smith is driving the weld down.
Two processes are acting here, one lengthwise and
one downward. This makes the best weld, from the
fact that the two ends that come together have a
welding heat on the whole surface of each, a condition
hard to get in any other kind of weld.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_278.jpg" width="500" height="238" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Flat Scarf</div>
</div>

<p><i>Lap weld:</i> Two flat pieces are laid face to face,
as shown in picture, and are welded. One must
be careful that the two pieces have the same temperature,
otherwise the colder piece would cut into
the hotter and make a defect.</p>

<div class="caption">Split scarf, cleft weld</div>
</div>

<p><i>Cleft weld:</i> If the weld is required to stand much
strain, such as in parts of a locomotive frame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
pieces are generally joined by the cleft weld.
One piece is upset and split with a chisel.
The two sides are spread apart. The other
piece is scarfed on both edges to fit into this
opening. If the pieces are very large much
of the welding can be done while in the fire.
The two pieces are placed together, in the proper
position, in the fire. When the heat is hot
enough to weld they are driven endwise. This
drives the point of the one piece into the
crotch of the other. Take them out of the fire
and place upon an anvil or under a hammer.
Small pieces are welded in the same
way, except they may be driven with a
hand hammer on the end just before driving
upon the surface. The piece is reduced to the
proper size and finished.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_279.jpg" width="250" height="300" alt="Jump weld" />
</div>

<p><i>Jump weld:</i> When one piece
of metal is to be welded at
right angles to another piece, a
jump weld is made. Many are
made by using a bob punch,
making a hollow depression in
a flat piece, and a rounded or
button head shape on the end of the upright. Heat
the end of the upright and also the flat piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
around the bob punch hole to a welding heat.
Take them out of the fire and drive the button
head down into the hole made by the bob punch.</p>

<div class="caption">Corner plate</div>
</div>

<p>Another jump weld can be made in the following
way: when square iron is to be welded to square
iron, one end is upset and flattened. The other end
is simply upset a
little when the upright
is to be welded
to it. These
ends are brought
to a welding heat,
and the work is
finished as in the
first jump weld.
The hammer plays an important part in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
jump welds, for the scarf projecting at the base
must be welded by the hand hammer.</p>

MILD STEEL OR SOFT STEEL</small></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Mild</span> steel, or soft steel, is supplanting
wrought iron in many shops. Any
smith who has worked with this metal
will always prefer it to wrought iron. It is much
stronger and can be bent, forged, and twisted in
all manner of shapes, without cracking or splitting.
This cannot be said of wrought iron. Therefore,
when mild steel is used one is sure of finishing
his problem, provided he understands the
process of heating it. The matter of heating
mild steel is the vital thing. It should never
be worked at a welding heat or below a red
heat. If worked either above or below this point
it will show it by splitting or cracking before the
problem is finished. Large crystals formed by
working at or above the welding heat will cause the
breaks, and internal fractures when working at the
low heat will cause the cracks. However, this
can be worked at a black red heat if the blows
delivered affect only the surface and do not penetrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
to the centre. This metal lends itself to
forging better than wrought iron does. It is very
good for most kinds of forging and particularly good
for making weldless rings. One of the best problems
to illustrate one of the many uses to which soft steel
may be put is the making of a weldless ring.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<a id="i_285"></a><img src="images/i_285.jpg" width="350" height="308" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Weldless rings</div>
</div>

<p>A piece of soft steel
1 in. wide, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. thick,
4 ins. long, is the stock
used for this ring.
With a centre-punch
mark off <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. from
each end. (See <a href="#i_285">sketch</a>.)
In each centre-punch
mark punch a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in.
hole through the
piece. With a hot chisel cut between these holes
half way through on one side. Turn it upside
down and finish cutting through from the other
side. Now drive the chisel through, widening
the slot out. Trim up the inside of the slot. Cut
away all rough edges. Upset the piece on the
anvil after heating and drive down on the ends.
This will increase the size of the hole by shortening
the length and bulging the sides out. The piece is
now put on the horn of the anvil and rounded into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
a ring. The ends are now trimmed off or driven
down into the thickness, as shown in the drawing.
This is the method of making a weldless ring.
It is easily made out of soft steel. It would require
a very fine grade of wrought iron to do a piece of
work of this kind, for wrought iron is fibrous and
unless great care is exercised in forging it will split
at the ends along the grain when opening it after
the slot is cut in.</p>

<p>Steel is much cheaper than wrought iron, another
good reason for its use. For the making of nuts,
too, it is better than wrought iron. All one needs
to do is to cut a piece off the end of a square bar,
the proper thickness, punch a hole in it, and square
it up. If wrought iron were used, to get the same
strength one would need to bend the iron around a
mandrel in the shape of a ring so that the grain of
the iron would run around the hole of the nut.
Then it should be welded and shaped into a square
nut.</p>


<h4>CHAIN HOOK OF SOFT STEEL</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_287.jpg" width="600" height="674" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A chain hook</div>
</div>

<p>Up to the present time our work has been with
wrought iron entirely. This hook is to be made
out of soft Bessemer steel, which of course is very
different from high carbon steel. It is the cheapest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of the steels. All building material, railroad rails,
boiler plates, steel cars, etc., are made of this cheap
soft metal. The
process of manufacture
is quite simple.
Molten cast iron,
taken from the cupola,
or blast furnace,
is poured
directly into a so-called
Bessemer converter&mdash;a
pear
shaped vessel. Air
is blown through the mass of molten metal. The
air adds oxygen to the bath, and increases the heat
to a temperature high enough to burn out all the
impurities from the cast iron. This converts it
into steel. It requires no more than nine or ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
minutes to convert fifteen tons of cast iron into
soft steel. The air is shut off and a sufficient
amount of ferro-manganese is added so as to give
the proper amount of carbon. The liquid steel
is poured into ingots and these ingots while still
hot are rolled into the shape used for the market.
A piece of this kind of steel you are going to use to
make a hook. Soft steel can be worked in the
same way as you work wrought iron. It is not
fibrous like wrought iron and is not apt to split
unless worked at a low temperature.</p>

<p>These square corners

the same kind of
punch as you did to make
the nut. While using the
punch keep cooling it off
in cold water to prevent its
getting hot; if you do not,
the end is apt to burr and
rivet itself into the iron.
It also prevents its sticking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
into the hole. Place the ring of the eye on the point
of the anvil and round up carefully with light blows

<p>When rounded up drive the punch in again to
the required size. This finishes the eye. The
body of the piece is now gone over carefully with
calipers and square to get the diameters and length.
Bend the small point at right angles to the axis
of the hook, like the drawing. Now it is ready for
bending in the middle. Heat the middle very hot.
Cool off the point about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. Place the middle
on the horn of the anvil and strike upon the small
turned up cold nib to bend the hook from this point.
By striking upon the cold end to bend it one can
do so without destroying the shape. It will stand
a lot of work upon it when cold.</p>

<p>When the hook is bent around as nearly like the
drawing as you can, flatten it out at its widest part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
by laying it upon the anvil and striking with the

<h4>FLAT WRENCHES</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p>Wrenches are used for screwing nuts on bolts.
They can be made in two ways: (1) One known as
the solid wrench is made without welding, (2) the
other, is made of wrought iron and is welded.</p>

<p><i>S wrench of soft steel:</i> The sketch here is of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
wrench made from soft steel <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 1 &times; 5 ins. Fuller
down the stock edgewise as shown. Draw out the
centre <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. thick and taper it from
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> to <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 5 ins. long. Cut the corner
off, as shown by the dotted
lines, and round the two ends up to
the size given. Punch a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. hole
in the large end and a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. hole in the small end
of the bar. With a sharp chisel cut a V-shaped
plug out of each end, tangent to the circles.</p>

<img src="images/i_294.jpg" width="200" height="153" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Wrench hardie</div>
</div>

<p><i>Jaws:</i> The jaws of the wrench are finished with
a tool called a wrench hardie, placed usually on the
anvil for the purpose of finishing up work of this
kind. Finish up both ends in the same way. Heat
the wrench at the nick and cool the jaws off in water.
Place the nick on the horn of the anvil and bend
it as shown. Repeat on the other end. If the
wrench is carefully made it will require no filing
to fit the nut. These wrenches are sometimes
polished and case hardened to prevent the jaws
from wearing while in use.</p>

<p><i>Large flat wrench:</i> A quick way to make a large
wrench is to make it of wrought iron. A piece of
iron 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 4 ins. is bent at almost a right angle.
The inside corner is the corner made by the natural
bend the metal takes when shaping it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">Wrenches</div>
</div>

<p>Scarf this corner by placing the peen of the
hammer on the corner and striking the face of the
hammer with the sledge or by using a bob punch
if one is available, or it may be made by using the
peen of the hammer without the use of a helper.
Select a piece of round iron <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. in diameter.
Upset the end of this and scarf it to fit the scarf made
in the angle piece. Heat both pieces to a welding
heat. Place them on the anvil and weld the handles
to the jaws. The inside is rounded up at the same
time the scarfs are being welded into place. Draw
the points out to a short taper and bend them up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the shape of a wrench on the heel of the anvil.
This is a simple way of making a large wrench that
can be used for all kinds of work.</p>

<p><i>Alligator wrench:</i> Stock 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 5 ins. steel.
The alligator wrench is one of the handiest tools

is indispensable
and is easily made.
Mark off 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. from the end of the stock. This is
the jaw part. Place the other end of the stock in the

draw the handle out <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. wide, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 8 ins. long, and
tapering to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. at the extreme end. The
edges of the handle should be rounding. Place the

hole back 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. from the end. Draw out the end
and shape as shown in the drawing. With a three-cornered
file, file the teeth on a slant and close together.
This slanting will allow the wrench to
let go of the work better than those filed at right
angles to the axis of the piece. The teeth should
slant backward and should be put only on one side
of the jaw. Both jaws should be hardened and
tempered a blue colour. To do this, heat the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
of the steel back of the jaw to a red heat and plunge
the whole into water one inch beyond the depth of
the jaw. When cold take it out and polish. Draw
the temper in the same way as you would for a
knife blade. (See article on <a href="#Page_289">tempering and
hardening</a>.)</p>


<h4>SOCKET WRENCHES</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_297.jpg" width="600" height="179" alt="Socket wrench" />
</div>

<p>Socket wrenches are useful for tightening nuts
in places that are difficult to reach. It is most
convenient when many nuts of the same size are
used, as bolting shaft irons for vehicles, etc. Some
are made to fit an auger brace; some have solid
handles with a cross bar, and some have holes
punched in the shanks to place the iron bars in while
twisting the nut on the bolt. This drawing shows
a style of wrench in general use. It can be made
in two different ways. One is called the welding
method, the other is the solid method.</p>

<p><i>Welding method:</i> Cut a piece of metal <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 1 in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of Norway iron. The length of this bar must be
determined by the size of the nut it is to be used for.
Heat one end of the piece of iron and scarf it. Repeat
on the other end. Bend the piece into a collar
or ring, weld the two ends
together, forming a cylinder
about 1 in. deep&mdash;any diameter.
Select a piece of round iron for the shank,
the size depending upon the size of the socket.
Upset one end of the round iron to fit the collar
made.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_298.jpg" width="600" height="134" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Weld collar, then put stem in, and weld</div>
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_298a.jpg" width="300" height="114" alt="Shank" />
</div>

<p>Drive the shank into the collar about one half the
depth of the collar, place it in the fire, and at a
welding heat weld the collar to the shank. If the
wrench is to be for a hexagonal nut, make a hexagonal
drift pin (a square one for a square nut), and
drive the pin into the collar. Place it all on a swage
and round up with a top swage. Drive the collar
down until it takes the shape of the drift pin. To
do this successfully requires many heatings, and it
can be done only while the metal is hot enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
yield always under the hammer blows. Should
the drift pin stick after the collar is driven into it,
place the pin on the anvil, giving it a slanting blow.
This will loosen the pin and it will come out easily.</p>

<p>The shank should now be driven down as shown
in the sketch, and two holes punched in at right
angles to each other. These are holes to place iron
bars for turning the wrench. These holes can be
made in two ways: one, by forming lugs or bosses
on the shank and punching holes in each one, or,
a sharp tapered round punch, flat and sharp on the
end, can be used to split the metal and force the
sides out as the punch is driven in.</p>

<p>If the cross bar is to be used in place of the holes,
a cleft scarf made in one end of the shank and a
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. bar of iron welded to this about 4 or 6 inches
long on either side of the shank will act as a handle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_299.jpg" width="500" height="128" alt="Open-sleeve or socket wrench" />
</div>

<p><i>Open-sleeve or socket wrench:</i> The wrench given
here is for practically the same use as the one just
described. It is lighter than the other. The opening
is longer and allows the bolt to protrude through
the nut without forcing the wrench off. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
wrench is made of machine steel, and the size must
be determined by the size of the nut.</p>

the fuller will measure <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. Draw these ends
out to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. any length. Cut the four corners
off and make the centre round. Bend

hole through the boss. Be careful
to prevent cold-shuts while doing this.
Drive a drift pin into the hole and forge the shape
as shown. Bend the two arms as shown and
weld together. These should be worked down
to a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. round. The ends can be made into
a brace shank by
squaring the end
and tapering it to
fit the jaws of the
brace. Or weld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
a piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. round iron long enough to bend
it into the shape of a brace, putting a round
knob on the end for
a hand hold. This
makes a simple wrench
and one that can be
used in many places where flat wrenches are not
convenient.</p>

<img src="images/i_301b.jpg" width="300" height="139" alt="Open the jaws out" />
</div>

<p>These sockets are made for wire cables, ropes,
etc., and are best
made of mild steel.
Place the end of a
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. square bar
in the fire and reduce it as shown in the
sketch. Cut two outside corners off, as shown
by the dotted lines. Round the ends up. Punch
a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. hole 2 ins. from the rounded end in the
centre of the piece.
Then cut a piece
out with a sharp
chisel, equal to the
width of the hole.
With the fuller, open the jaws out. Now cut
the socket off 4 ins. from the rounded end and drill a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. hole through this end of the socket. A drift
pin <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. on one end and tapered to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. on the
other is now driven
into the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. hole at
the jaw side.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

</div>

<p>Forge the shank as
shown in the drawing while the drift pin is in.
While forging keep driving the drift pin into
the hole. When finished the hole should measure
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. at the large end
and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. at the small
end. When the socket
is finished cut the ends
square and smooth up.
During all the time the steel should never be worked
below a red heat and most of the time at a high
heat, below welding heat, until it is ready for finishing.
Now the jaws are ready to be closed. This
is done by placing
a piece of flat iron,
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. thick and
the width of the
jaw, in between
the opening, and close the jaws on this either with
the hand hammer or a flatter. Drill a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in.
hole in the middle of the end. This is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
for the pin. Make a pin to fit this hole out of
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. round stock. Upset the end of the bar a
little and place it in
a heading tool, driving
down and forming a
head <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. thick and
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter.
Take it out of the heading tool, cut the bolt off
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. longer than the width of the jaws. This
allows for a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. hole and pin. A small <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in.
hole is now drilled in the shank of the bolt and a
split pin is put into the hole to prevent its falling
out. The split pin is made by flattening down a
piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. wire in a small swage to a half round.
Now double over to form an eye on one end of the
two flat planes coming together. When this is
put in through the hole, a chisel put in the opening
will widen out the ends, thus preventing them from
falling out.</p>

around a drift pin as shown in the drawing and
welded along the dotted lines. This is done by
scarfing the end of the bar into a short tapered point.
Bend it down at right angles about 3 in. from the
end. Bend it in the opposite direction about <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>
of the way around. Put in the drift pin. This
now forms a hook shape. Continue the driving over
until the scarf lies flat on the straight side. Take
out the drift pin and weld the scarf to the body of
the hinge. Drive the drift pin into the hole, shaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
it up. The back of the hinge is perfectly straight
so that it will lie flat upon the wooden door. The
other end is drawn out, tapered and the end rounded
up, and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. holes punched in as shown.</p>

<p>Bent hinges,
such as are used
on tail boards for
wagons, railroad
cars, etc., are
simply ends of
the iron piece bent around at a given diameter, with the
under side flat, and the stock rolled up on one side.
These hinges may be used in pairs. In that case a
long rod is pushed through, connecting the two hinges.</p>


<h4>TONGS</h4>

placed on an anvil
and flattened down
to 1 &times; 2 &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in.,
leaving the shoulder as shown. (1) Heat the piece

piece extending beyond the anvil, and, with
the shoulder on the outer edge of the anvil, flatten
this down 1 in. wide, and <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. thick. (2) Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>

then rounded 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. on
the ends to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> ins. in diameter.
A hole is now
punched through the eye of
the jaw and a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. rivet inserted. The little groove
which you see in the jaw is put there with a fuller.
This is done so that you can use it to hold small
round iron as well as flat iron. The two parts are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
now riveted together. This is done either by
making a head on a rivet and cutting it off, allowing
about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. for a head on the end that goes
through the tongs,
then heating the
tongs and completing
the riveting, or,
as many smiths do,
by putting a piece
of straight <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in.
iron in, allowing <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
in. on each end plus
the thickness of the
parts of the tongs for riveting. This piece of
iron is made very hot, put into the hole, and both
heads are riveted on at the same time. It frequently
happens that the rivet bends in the holes while
hammering on the ends. This prevents the tongs
from opening easily. If such is the case, put the
rivet and jaws into the fire and heat red hot. Hold
the handle, open and close the jaws while cooling.
This not only centres the rivet but prevents sticking.
The tongs should work smooth and free when
cooled off in water.</p>

HARDENING AND TEMPERING: TOOL MAKING</small></h3>


<h4>EFFECTS OF CARBON ON STEEL</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">What</span> is commonly known as carbon steel is
a metal composed of iron containing varying
amounts of carbon. Steels containing
much carbon are called tool steels to distinguish them
from the low carbon steels. Tool steel, when heated
red hot and plunged into cold water, will harden,
while low carbon steel treated in the same way will
not do so. This is an excellent way of testing two bars
of steel for carbon when one is not able to distinguish
grades of steel accurately. It is carbon that gives
the hardening quality. When steel is heated it
becomes red at 1000&deg; F. At 1300&deg; F. it passes
a point at which it absorbs considerable heat without
any increase in the temperature, showing that
some change in the structure of the metal must be
taking place. If the steel is heated above this point
and allowed to cool slowly, a brightening of the
colour may be noticed as it passes this point, known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
as the point of recalescence. The brightening is
due to a liberation of the heat previously absorbed.</p>

<p><i>Method of heating steel in forge fires:</i> All steel
work, including tool dressing, hardening, and tempering,
was formerly done in an ordinary forge fire.
Now we have special furnaces for that purpose.
However, in using a forge fire, care must be taken
to insure good work. The fire must be very deep&mdash;that
is, a large body of coke must be put between
the tuyere, and the tool, so as to prevent the blast
reducing the carbon on the surface of the steel.
Sulphur will injure the quality of any steel tool.
Hence, a fuel low in sulphur should be used. Charcoal
is the best for this purpose, but the cost and the
difficulty in maintaining the heat prevent its general
use in blacksmith shops. If the coal does contain
sulphur a great deal of it can be extracted or reduced
by one making his own coke. This is done
by burning the green coal to a coke and in this
way driving off much of the sulphur. Gas furnaces
or oil furnaces are used. This is much better than
coal, for a uniform heat can be kept and an oxidation
of the steel prevented. Whether natural or
artificial gas is used, all that is necessary is to adjust
the supply of gas in such a way that there will be
a very slight excess of gas present beyond the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
amount for combustion. The presence of this gas
excludes all air from the steel and therefore prevents
its oxidizing the surface of the metal.</p>

<p><i>Heating in lead:</i> In order to prevent oxidation
molten lead makes a most satisfactory bath. The
lead is melted in a cast-iron pot and heated in the
forge. The steel must be left in the bath until
it has all been heated to the required temperature.
As the steel will float in the molten lead it must
be weighted down to keep it submerged.</p>

<p><i>Hardening solutions:</i> In many cases clear cold
water is used in hardening steel. Some use soft
or rain water. The temperature of the water for
general work should not fall below the temperature
of the shop; otherwise it would extract the heat too
quickly from the steel and cause cracks or breaks
in the work.</p>

<p><i>Salt solution:</i> Salt is often added to water which
is to be used as a hardening solution. (1) It increases
the rate at which the bath will extract
the heat from the steel; (2) it prevents the formation
of steam on the surface of the water. Put
as much salt in rain water as it will dissolve. This
is considered one of the best and easiest made
solutions for hardening steel.</p>

<p><i>Oil solution:</i> Linseed oil, lard, cotton seed oil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
whale oil, and melted tallow make good hardening
solutions. They are used mostly for fine work.
The oil prevents the sudden chilling of the steel
and lessens the chances of cracking and breaking.
Springs are mostly tempered in oil.</p>

<p><i>Metallic hardening baths:</i> For very delicate tools
mercury is sometimes used. It has a greater heat
conductivity than any solution mentioned. However,
the fumes given off are poisonous and for this
reason it is not extensively used.</p>


<h4>TEMPERING: THE PART COLOUR PLAYS</h4>

<p>When you buy steel for tools from a merchant
he will assure you that the steel he sells you will
harden at a cherry-red heat. This is true provided
the metal has not been spoiled either by overheating
it or working it at too low a heat during the making.
This causes cracks or internal fractures.</p>

<p>If these directions for working steel are followed
out a tool should harden at a cherry-red heat when
plunged into water. When the steel is heated to
the proper temperature, usually a cherry red, and
plunged into a hardening solution, it will be very
brittle, so that a file will not cut it. One test often
used is to take a fine mill cut file and try to cut the
hardened part of the tool. If it slips over the surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
without cutting, the steel is considered hard; if
the file cuts, the steel is not hard enough. Re-heat
the steel hotter than before, cool it off in water,
and test again. All cutting tools should possess a
certain amount of hardness or toughness. When
the steel has been plunged into cold water it is too
hard for use. It is necessary to then reduce this
hardness so that one can use the tool for the particular
kind of work it is made to do. This process
of reducing the hardness is commonly called drawing
the temper, and the colour scheme plays a very important
part in this operation. Perhaps the steps will
be clearer if the process of drawing the temper on a
cold chisel is explained: After the chisel is forged
the proper shape, place the body of the tool in the
fire, heat it red hot back of the point. Now heat
the point to a uniform cherry-red heat, plunge 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
in. of this hot point into the water and hold it there
until it is quite cold. This is determined by water
clinging to the point when the chisel is taken out.
Polish the part cooled off with a piece of emery
stone, an old brickbat, or any rough polishing
material. You will notice a group of temper colours
starting from the point where the tool came into
contact with the water. The heat in the body of
the tool gives rise to these colours as it is conducted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
through the cold point of the steel. In this group
of colours the first will be (1) pale yellow, (2) a
full straw colour, (3) brown, (4) purple, (5) dark
blue, (6) full blue, (7) light blue, (8) gray. This
colour scheme corresponds to varying temperatures
in the metal. The first colour (pale yellow) accompanies
a temperature of 430&deg;, while the last
colour, gray, means a temperature of 700&deg;. The
colours show, too, a varying in the hardness or
toughness of the steel. A cold chisel should be
tempered a blue; so when the blue reaches the
cutting end of the tool the end should be plunged
immediately into water and cooled off. This is
the principle of hardening and tempering all common
tools.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_314.jpg" width="600" height="235" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Colors, left to right: pale yellow, straw color, brown, purple, dark blue, full blue,
light blue, gray</div>
</div>

<p>However, these colours mean nothing so far as
tempering is concerned unless the cutting edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the steel has been thoroughly hardened. Then the
colours have a real value. To prove that these
colours are no test unless hardening precedes,
take a piece of brass, or copper, or soft iron. Polish,
then heat the piece in the fire to the temperature
given here. You find the same set of colours, but
you cannot use any of these metals for cutting
tools.</p>

<p>The table of temper colours given in this book
shows the colour required for tempering tools most
commonly used.</p>

<p><i>Tempering of springs:</i> Under the head of springs
we may include every variety, from the small spring
used in locks and fire-arms to the largest springs
in use. They are made of spring steel of the required
thickness, forged into shape, then hardened
and tempered.</p>

<p>This hardening and tempering of springs is done
in some cases by polishing and heating over a fire
and drawing them to a blue colour. Then they are
plunged into oil to fix the temper. Sometimes
springs are heated red hot and cooled in oil, then
held over the fire until the oil burns with a bright
flame on the spring. It is then allowed to
cool in the air. If the spring is found too
hard, more oil is put on it and the operation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
repeated until the desired spring movement is
obtained.</p>


<h4>TOOL MAKING</h4>

<p>It is possible for you to learn to make all of the
tools you may need to use, including hammers. And
not only will you be able to make blacksmiths'
tools, but such as are used by carpenters, bricklayers,
stone-masons, machinists, etc. You must
not expect to be able to do this work at first, but
in a little while you will be able to replace your
first working tools with those of your own make.
From time to time, as the tools break or wear out,
you can repair them or replace them with new ones.
This gives excellent practice in forging and handling
steel, and prepares you for more and more advanced
work, an experience necessary for doing any work
well.</p>

<p><i>Steel:</i> There are many different grades of steel,
depending upon the percentage of carbon contained
in each. Steel low in carbon can be easily welded
but cannot be tempered. Carbon steel is very
difficult to weld and it can be done only by the use
of borax or some other flux. High carbon steel
or so-called tool steel, can be tempered. It is used
for making cold chisels, files, drills, cutting tools, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
<i>Crucible steel:</i> All tools are made from crucible
cast steel. The cast steel is made by placing in a
graphite crucible a certain amount of wrought iron
and soft steel, and carbon is added in the form of
manganese. These are all melted in furnaces.
When melted they are poured into ingots and drawn
or shaped to sizes for the market under different
kinds of power hammers. These various size bars
are used for the making of all kinds of tools. The
tools we are going to make are (1) centre-punch,
(2) cold chisel, (3) cape chisel, and (4) lathe tools.
There are five lathe tools; (1) round nose, (2) diamond
point, (3) side tool, (4) cutting off or parting
tool, (5) inside or boring tool.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_317.jpg" width="600" height="278" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Centre-punch</div>
</div>

<p><i>Centre-punch:</i> You will find the centre-punch
a most useful tool to have on hand. It is used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
for marking centres before drilling holes, starting
points in work, etc. A small one is made out of a
piece of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. hexagonal tool steel, 3 ins. long.
Put one end into the fire and taper it <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. long to
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter, as shown in the sketch. Make
this end flat. Put the other end into the fire and
draw it into a sharp tapered round point to about
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. on the end. This extreme point is ground to
a very sharp point. The angles of the extreme
should be about 45&deg;. This is hardened and tempered
a blue colour. Then it is ready for use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_318.jpg" width="600" height="206" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Cold Chisel</div>
</div>

<p><i>Cold chisel:</i> Cold chisels are usually made out
of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. hexagonal tool steel, 6 in. long. The form
and dimensions are given here.</p>

<p>Heat one end of the bar and place it upon the
anvil. Draw it out for the short end. This is
the part upon which the hammering is done when
the tool is finished. The surplus stock is cut off
with a hot chisel and the short end is flattened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
When cutting tool steel of any kind the chisel
should be very sharp and the steel red hot. Put
the other end of the bar into the fire, beginning back
about 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. from the end. Flatten it down to
a chisel shape, as shown in the drawing. Cut the
surplus stock off, harden and temper as explained
before for the cold chisel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">Cape chisel</div>
</div>

<p><i>Cape chisel:</i> The drawing gives the form and the
dimensions. The small end of this tool is forged
out in the same way as you forged the small end
of the cold chisel. Reverse the bar and heat the
other end. Two inches back from the end fuller
the metal down as shown in the drawing. Draw
it out tapering. This end, too, is cut off, hardened
and tempered as you did the cold chisel. Cape
chisels are used mostly for cutting key ways in shafting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
The point being wider than the rest of the
blade gives clearance while cutting.</p>


<h4>LATHE TOOLS</h4>

<p><i>Round nose:</i> The drawing gives the form and the
dimensions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="i_320"></a><img src="images/i_320.jpg" width="500" height="219" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Round nose</div>
</div>

<p><i>Stock:</i> A piece of <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 7 in. tool steel.</p>

<p>This size best fits the tool post of the lathe. You
see by the <a href="#i_320">sketch</a> that one end is bevelled. This
end is always made first. It is done by heating
and chamfering the edges down with a hand hammer.
Place the other end in the fire and draw it out to a
sharp point in both directions. Throw the bevel
on one side by placing the tool on the anvil and
driving one side of the metal down to the other
side. The point is now cut off on a bevel for clearance.</p>

<p>The drawing shows a cross section view of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
tool. Notice that it is smaller on the bottom than
on the cutting edge. This is done by reducing one
side more than the other. The cutting edge of the
tool should extend about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub> in. above the common
level.</p>

<p><i>Hardening and tempering:</i> All lathe tools of this
type are hardened and tempered in the same way
as you did the cold chisel. The temper colour of
this tool is a very light straw. When this colour
reaches the extreme point plunge the tool into water.
The slight change of temperature does not materially
lessen the degree of hardness, but it does toughen
the tool so that it will do more work.</p>

<a id="i_322"></a><img src="images/i_322.jpg" width="600" height="390" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Side tool</div>
</div>

<p>Heat one end and bevel it off as you did when
making the round nose tool. Place the other end in
the fire, <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. from the end, and fuller down to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
half the thickness of the bar. This fullering is
done on the bottom fuller, which is placed on the
anvil. Re-heat this end, place it again on the fuller
in the depression made, and with the hand hammer
draw this end out and at the same time square it
up into a diamond point by turning the tool at an
angle of 45&deg; with the anvil. Turn again, in exactly
the opposite direction. Repeat this until the point
of the tool is drawn out as shown by the sketch.
The clearance should not be more than that shown.
It is now cut off by placing the face of the diamond
on the outer edge of the anvil. Place the cold
chisel above this edge, strike the chisel with the
sledge hammer and cut it off. If this is carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
done it will cut the proper bevel for the cutting
edge. The drawing shows the slope of the cutting
edge to be parallel to the top of the tool. The tool
is hardened and tempered the same as the round
nose tool.</p>

<p><i>Side tool (right hand):</i> The form and dimensions
are given here.</p>

<p><i>Stock:</i> 7 &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in.</p>

<p>To make a tool of this kind bevel off the end
of the stock, place the other end in the fire, and heat
about two inches to a red heat. Take it out and
place about one inch of this on the round edge of
the anvil. With the hand hammer reduce the
thickness of this steel, driving on the edge nearest
you (see <a href="#i_322">sketch marked A</a>). The hammering reduces
the thickness of the edge, which will be the
cutting edge when finished. The part opposite
to where you are working will be reduced very little.
A chisel is now used for cutting the cutting edge on
the tool (<a href="#i_322">see B</a>). Place the tool on a piece of soft
iron, place the chisel along the line and cut through
to the soft iron below. This gives not only a clear
cut but prevents the chisel from driving in if it
should strike the hard anvil. The clearance is
cut off along the other lines. (<a href="#i_322">C</a>) The cutting
edge is now offset. To do this use a set hammer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Push the part made beyond the anvil <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. Place
the set hammer in this shoulder, drive down until
the offset is driven down about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. (D).</p>

<p>The method of tempering this tool is a little
different from the way you have tempered other
tools, on account of the length of the cutting edge,
which should be hardened its full length. Place
the end just finished in the fire and heat to a red
heat. Plunge the whole tool into water. Take
it out and polish the cutting edge with emery stone.
Now place in the fire a piece of any kind of iron;
1 in. square will do. Heat it red hot, then place
it upon the anvil, and lay the part of your tool that
has been hardened on the hot bar. It will draw
enough heat from the hot bar to produce the temper
colours. This is one way to give a piece of hardened
steel the heat to temper it when the body of that
piece does not contain heat enough to do so.</p>

work to be done must determine the size and length
of the boring tool. This is not true of any other

<p><i>Stock:</i> 7 &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.</p>

<p>Bevel one end. Place the other end in the fire

octagonal shape, as shown in the sketch. The
end is pushed over the anvil about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. Drive
it down at right angles. The clearance for the
cutting edge is cut off with a hot chisel and made
ready for hardening and tempering.</p>

Put the top fuller on this, then put the steel between
the two fullers about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. from the end. Using
the sledge hammer, drive down so that the centre
thickness will measure <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. Draw the lump left
on the end to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. thickness, the same width as
the tool. The drawing shows that the clearance
on this tool is one half the thickness of the cutting
edge, or <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. This clearance must be put on as
shown in the drawing, otherwise the tool will not
clear while doing the cutting. Finish up as shown
in the sketch. Harden and temper in the same way
as you did the round nose tool. Cutting off tools
are made with the shoulder all on one side. (See

HOW TO HARDEN, SOFTEN, AND STRETCH STEEL</small></h3>


<h4>ANNEALING OR SOFTENING OF STEEL</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">All</span> steels that are worked under hammers and
heated to any degree of temperature, when
finished should be softened by heating, so
that the unequal strains caused by the working of
the metal may be neutralized. When the work is
entirely finished it is placed in a furnace or forge
fire and heated red hot. Then the fire is either
withdrawn from the furnace, or the blast is shut
off from the forge, and the metal is allowed to cool
off as the fire goes down. This softens the metal
and saves it from the danger of unequal strains.</p>

<p>Hard or high carbon steels are treated in a different
way. The metal is heated red hot, then it is placed
in a box filled with slack lime. The lime completely
covers the piece. The cold air is prevented from
striking it and cooling it off too quickly. When
no lime is at hand wood ash can be used.</p>

<p>Sometimes the steel is heated red hot, then held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
until the red entirely disappears. Then it is plunged
into cold water. This process is known as water
annealing and is a process used for tool steel when
quick work is required. It softens the metal so
that it can be filed and worked quite easily.</p>


<h4>CASE HARDENING</h4>

<p>We have learned that carbon gives the hardening
quality to steel. Since there is little carbon in
soft steel and none in wrought iron, they will not
harden as carbon steel does when heated red hot
and plunged into water. But there are many small
articles which are best made of this soft steel and
iron and which must be hardened in some way to
make them useful. In order to supply the lacking
carbon the metal is put through a process known
as case hardening. There are two methods of
case hardening. The first method is to heat a
piece of soft steel or iron red hot and cover the part
to be hardened with cyanide of potassium. The
metal will absorb the carbon out of the cyanide
and when cooled in water will have taken on a
hardened surface. If this is repeated two or three
times the hard surface deepens.</p>

<p>Any drug store will sell you some cyanide of potassium.
It comes in cakes. The cakes are broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
up into small pieces. Be careful to keep the hands
as much as possible from contact with the cyanide.</p>


<h4>SET SCREW</h4>

<p>Set screws are made of soft metal, but the points
must be hardened to resist the wear. This is done
by heating the set screws red hot, then sticking
the point into the cyanide until it cools off. Re-heat
and repeat the work. During this time the
iron is absorbing carbon. Heat again, plunge into
cold water. The carbon forms a case on the end of
the screw. Now you have a screw hard on the outside
but of soft material in the inside. It is able
to resist any shock that carbon steel itself could not
stand.</p>

<p>The second method calls for the use of pulverized
charcoal and bone. The principle is the same as
in the first method. The iron articles to receive a
case hardening are placed in a cast-iron box with a
layer of charcoal above and a layer of bone dust
below, alternating in this way until the box is filled
to the top. The box is then placed in a heating
furnace and heated to a temperature 1200&deg; F. It
is kept at this temperature from three to four hours.
The articles all this time are absorbing charcoal
from bone dust. The box is taken out of the furnace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
and plunged into a bath of cold water. From
this cold bath it is plunged into a bath of boiling
water, then taken out and dried. The pieces are
oiled over slightly to bring out the colours. They
have not only a hard exterior after this process, but
they have a beautiful mottled surface of grays and
blues, colours one often sees in parts of small guns,
wrenches, etc.</p>

<p>Surgical instruments, guns, small wrenches, etc.,
are hardened in this way. The equipment for the
second method is much more expensive than that
for the first; however, the principles involved are
the same in both cases.</p>


<h4>BRAZING</h4>

<p>Brazing is a process of joining two pieces of metal
by the use of another metal, such as brass or copper.
The use of solder has been explained in the article
on soldering. This article will tell about brazing of
wrought iron, cast-iron, and steel in the forge fire.</p>

<p>One must bear in mind that when a forge fire is
used for brazing, the fire should be free from green
coal on account of the presence of sulphur. A
reducing fire is best for that purpose. It is well to
mention here that a forge fire that has been used for
brazing must be thoroughly cleaned before it can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
be used again for any welding purposes. The
brass will run down and clog the tuyere. If the least
bit of smelter is left on the forge it is apt to mix
with the coals. In that case it would find its way
into the fire, melt, and collect on any iron that
may be in the fire heating. The success of any of
these operations depends absolutely upon a clean
fire and a clean piece of work to be done.</p>

<p><i>To prepare the pieces to be brazed:</i> All parts to
be brazed should be free from any foreign matter.
They should be filed or polished with emery cloth
or sand-paper. This refers not only to the parts
that come into contact with each other, but both
sides of the contact edge for the depth of at least
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. When the parts are clean, put them together.
See that the joints fit. Paint the joints
with a flux made of boracic acid. Mix one part
boiling water with one part borax and two parts
boracic acid. Keep it pasty so that it can be
handled with a brush. Ordinary borax can be used
if the other is not at hand. The smelter (brass) can
be bought at supply stores. However, brass filings,
common sheet brass, or brass wire is just as good.
If brass filings are used these should be mixed with
the flux. Any old tin can will do for the mixing.
A spoon for dipping the flux out when wanted can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
be made on the end of a rod <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter, about
20 ins. long, by flattening out an inch of the end,
drawn out quite thin and fashioned spoon shaped.
Place the parts to be brazed in the fire and heat till
they are red hot. Dip the spoon into the brazing
material and put a little of the smelter on the
joints. Increase the heat. When the smelter begins
to run add more. When it shows a bright
streak all around the parts to be joined shut off the
blast and let it cool before removing it from the
fire. When it is black hot remove it from the fire
and file into shape. Be very careful to see that
the pieces to be brazed are so fastened together that
they will not move apart when once put into place.
This can be done by packing brick or clay around
them or by clamping them in place. Do not put
any weight that would cause any strain upon
them, for when heated this would change the position
and might cause a bend in the brazed parts.</p>

<p><i>Brazing of cast-iron:</i> Cast-iron is prepared for
brazing in the same way as steel or iron is prepared.
The flux, however, is not the same. It is made up
of boric acid, 8 oz.; pulverized chlorate of potash,
4 oz.; carbonate of iron, 3 oz. Mix these together
thoroughly, breaking up all lumps that may be
there. Keep this mixture in a glass jar. Place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the pieces to be brazed in a fire as you did the iron
and steel. Heat it all red hot. Mix the flux
with the smelter and put it on. Do not put this
on at any time before the metal is red hot. Increase
the heat and add more flux and smelter.
When the brass has flowed into the joints, shut off
the heat and let the metal cool off in the fire. Cast-iron
requires a higher temperature for brazing than
iron or steel. If a brass rod is used in place of the
smelter, push the end of the rod in the joint to be
brazed. It will melt off as fast as it is pushed in.
When brazing some cast-iron, the break should be
reinforced on the unexposed side by a plate of
wrought iron or steel. If this is cleaned off thoroughly
and placed against the break the smelter
will not only fill up the break but it will hold this
piece of metal fast.</p>

<p><i>Brazing steel band saws:</i> Band saws break very
often while in use. They can be repaired only by
brazing the broken ends together. Do so by filing
each end of the broken pieces, tapering to a very
sharp edge <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in length for lapping over. The
length of this lapping depends upon the width of
the teeth of the saw. When the ends are filed,
place them in a vise that can be bought for this
purpose. If no vise is at hand two wood clamps, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
iron clamps, or an ordinary shop vise will answer
the purpose. Put the two ends overlapping in
place, and clamp close enough to these ends to keep
them in a straight line and, also, for shifting while
brazing. Paint the joint with flux, using the first
flux mentioned in the article. Put a piece of silver
solder between the laps. Now heat the jaws of a
pair of close tongs white hot, and grasp the joints
between the hot jaws, and pinch them together.
The heat in the tongs will melt the silver and braze
the two parts. Hold the tongs steady; if not,
they will bend, and the saw will be rather hard to
straighten when the tongs are removed. Do not
remove the tongs until they are black hot. Now
place the saw in a vise and file the teeth to correspond
to those on either side of the joint. Smooth
the roughness from the joint.</p>

<p><i>The value of brazing:</i> A knowledge of how to braze
is most useful to any one working with the metals.
Many things break that can be repaired only by
this process. For instance, tubing, automobile
parts, very complex parts of machinery, etc., when
broken cannot be welded; they must be mended by
brazing. The success of the process depends upon
the care taken to make the parts perfectly clean and
well fitted together. If this is well done the brazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
material will find its way to the closest joints and
fix them.</p>


<h4>PROCESSES OF STRETCHING IRON OR STEEL</h4>

<p>(1) <i>Drawing:</i> Stretching a piece of metal in one
or more directions either by hammering, or pulling,
or rolling, is called drawing. In the blacksmiths'
shop the term drawing always means a decrease
in the size of a cross section of the piece and an
increase in the length.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Bending:</i> Bending means making the metal
take a shape from a straight line. It may be made
into a circle or curved or bent at right angles.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Twisting:</i> In the process of twisting no
change is made in the axis of the piece. The
faces of the piece are changed; as for instance, when
you twist a piece of paper holding one end fast and
turning the other in the direction of its axis.</p>

<p><i>Upsetting:</i> Upsetting means increasing the thickness
of a piece of iron by shortening its length.</p>

<p><i>Forming:</i> Forming is the process of giving a
piece of iron shape, either by hammering or by using
some forming machine; for example, the bulldog.</p>

<p><i>Welding:</i> Welding means joining two pieces of
iron together by heating them to the right temperature
and hammering or pressing them together.</p>

FORGING HAND HAMMERS</small></h3>

</div>

<p>It is best to make this hammer on the end of a
bar. In this way you dispense with the handling
of tongs, and you are able to get the best control
of your material. Mark with a centre-punch, the
centre of the 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. piece. Through this, punch
a hole with an eye punch. (See eye punch in tool
list.) The hole will be a little less than the finished
size. Draw the face end slightly tapering. Drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
the four corners down and make the face of hammer
octagonal in shape. The sketch will show just
where to begin this knocking down. The hammer
is now cut off and the face squared up. The centre
of the face should be a little higher than the outer
edges. Now drive into the eye a drift pin. This
pin is made of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 4 in. steel. It is tapered
for the whole length down to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in., and oval
in shape. It is driven into the hole. This gives
the real shape to the eye of the hammer. Take
the pin out and re-heat the hammer. Draw the cross
peen out to a taper as you would if you were making
a cold chisel. Be careful to keep all within the dimensions
given. The hammer may now be filed and
polished if one wishes a bright hammer; otherwise,
it needs only to be tempered: then it is ready for
use.</p>

<p><i>To temper the hammer:</i> Place the whole hammer
in the fire and heat it red hot. Grasp it with a pair
of pick-up tongs through the eye. Dip the face in
water half way up to the eye, and hold it there
until the face is chilled off. Reverse by placing
the peen end into the water. While this is cooling
dip up enough water with the hand to keep the face
of the hammer cold. Take it out and polish both
ends with a piece of emery cloth wrapped around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
a piece of wood. The colours now are beginning to
run from the middle toward the ends. When the
purple colour reaches either end plunge that end
into water, holding it in the water until the purple
colour reaches the other end. Then plunge the
whole hammer in water. This tempering darkens
the hammer if it has been previously polished.
Rubbing well with emery cloth again will restore
the brightness. The hammer is ready for the
handle. A hammer of this kind can be made without
the help of a second person.</p>

<img src="images/i_339.jpg" width="500" height="218" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Step in making hammer</div>
</div>

<p><i>Stock:</i> A piece of
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. square tool steel. This hammer, too,
is best made on the end of a bar about 20 ins.
in length. With a centre-punch mark off 2 ins.
from the end. This spot marks the centre of the
eye. Place this end in the fire. One inch from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the end fuller down on the four sides of the bar
(1). This makes a neck one inch in diameter and
having eight sides. Place it back in the fire and
heat again. Now put the bar again on the
fuller 2 ins. from the first fuller (1). This time
fuller only two sides, the two sides opposite the
centre-punch mark. Fuller so that the thickness
measures 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. This means only <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. depression
on the two sides. Put again into the fire and draw
the first end out so that it measures 1 in. octagonal,
any length. (See <a href="#i_338">sketch 2</a>.) Heat again, this
time the whole body of the piece. Punch a hole
with the eye-punch where the centre-punch was
made. The hole will be a little less in size than the
finished hole will be (see <a href="#i_338">sketch</a>) to allow for the
increase in size while working the metal into shape.
Put the drift pin into the hole. Drive it through
until the small end just shows through on the other
side. Place a fuller over the hole and work the
metal out sidewise by striking on the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
fuller with a sledge hammer. This requires a helper
to do the heavy work. While the heavy work is
being done the steel must be heated many times,
but always without the drift pin. Keep the drift
pin in water while the hammer is being heated, as the
pin must always be cold when driven into the eye.
Drive it in a little farther each time, so that by the
time the centre is finished the hole will be the proper
size (3). The thickness of the metal around the eye
should be about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. on the outer edges and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in.
in the centre. This tapers a little from the centre
outward, as is shown in the drawings. Put the
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. bottom fuller on the anvil and place the neck
of the hammer on this
and a top fuller above
that. Strike on the fuller
and reduce the neck
until it measures about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter, keeping
the octagonal shape all the while.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_340.jpg" width="300" height="101" alt="Hammer head" />
</div>

<p>Heat the hammer again where the face should
be, and fuller down between the body and the face
so that this will measure about 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. square, using
the same large fullers as before and making it octagonal.
This finishes up completely the body of
the hammer between the face and the peen.</p>

<p>With a sharp chisel cut the hammer off an inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
and a half from the body. You will then have enough
stock for the face of the hammer.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_341.jpg" width="300" height="84" alt="Head with surplus stock" />
</div>

<p>The surplus stock on the peen allows for holding
with the tongs, and
the face of the hammer
is rounded up to
about 1<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. in diameter. Bevel the edges
down <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. back of this face and, with a sharp chisel,
trim the face off flat or square with the axis of the
hammer. The centre of the face should be a little
higher than the outside edges.</p>

<p>Grasp the face with the tongs and place the peen
in the fire. Take it out and cut it off 1 in. in length
and make the edges rounding. To shape the peen,
place the neck on a large fuller and round up as
shown in the picture. Be careful each time to give
it one eighth of a turn so that the octagonal shape
will not be lost. If the hammer has been carefully
forged it will require little finishing in the way of
filing, unless one wishes to make a fancy polished
hammer. If such a one is desired some draw
filing and polishing must be done. This makes the
hammer look better, but it doesn't increase its efficiency.
The tempering is done in the same way as
the tempering for the cross peen hammer was done.
However, this hammer is larger and heavier than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
the cross peen hammer and is more difficult to
temper. While the same principle is involved in
the tempering of both hammers, greater care must be
taken in tempering this one.</p>

<p>The handle is placed. You will find that the
driving of the drift pin into the eye, first on one
side and then on the other, makes both outside
openings larger than the centre. This should be so,
as it helps to hold the handle firmly in place.</p>


<h4>TOOL STEEL AND THE MAKING OF TOOLS</h4>

<p>Here are a few problems which deal with the
making of your own tools. When buying steel for
this work always tell what the steel is to be used for.
The merchant will probably recommend to you a
grade of steel from which you can make tools that
will last.</p>

<p><i>Hardie:</i> Take a piece of 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. square tool steel.
Make this tool on the end of a bar if the bar is long
enough. It is easier handled in that way. The
dotted lines on the drawing show the amount of
material required to make the shank. This should
be made to fit the hole in the anvil; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. from the
shank fuller down on the two sides of the steel,
leaving <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. thickness between the fuller marks.
Draw the end out to a 3-in. taper on one side and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
widen it out to 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. taper on the other. (See
<a href="#i_343">drawing</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p><i>Set hammer:</i> A set hammer is made with a piece
of 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. square steel; 1<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. from one end mark
the hole. Put one end of the bar into the fire and
heat it. Take it out and punch a hole with the eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
punch in the piece of steel when it is marked. Knock
the four corners down, bevelling them as shown in
the sketch, and trim the end off rounding for the
head. Cut it off 4 ins. long; fuller the four corners
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. from the face as shown in the sketch. The
end view of the drawing shows the depth of the fuller
marks.</p>

is fullered on the corners the hot chisel is fullered
on the two sides, and the end is drawn out tapering.

SOME GENERAL FORGING PROBLEMS</small></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="materials">Ice shaver:</span> Ice shavers are useful as shavers,
breakers and choppers of ice. They are made
out of a piece of low carbon steel for the blade
and a piece of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. round iron for the handle.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Take a piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 6 &times; 4 ins., and
cut along as shown by the lines. When these two
corners are cut out, point the centre piece for
a cleft weld. Slit the end of the rod, scarfing its
points thin, and slip this point into the crotch of
the scarf, and weld with borax. This now gives you
a piece that looks like a shovel. On the other end
of the handle bend a ring about 4 ins. in diameter.
Place the flat end in the fire, heat it up, and taper
this flat end down very thin, about 1 in. long. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
a file, file four teeth in the end, the same shape as
shown here. It is now ready for tempering. This
is done by heating all the teeth well back toward the
handle red hot. Plunge the whole thing into water
to cool it off. Take it out and polish. Heat a
piece of large iron in the fire red hot. On this piece
of metal place the teeth of the pick. When the
blue colour appears on the point and cutting edges
of the teeth, cool in water. It is now ready for use.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

</div>

<p><i>Grub hoe:</i> The form
and dimensions of this
tool are given, also the
different steps in the process of forging.</p>

<p><i>Stock:</i> 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 5 in. steel.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Mark off with a centre-punch the
middle of the piece of stock, and then mark off 1 in.
from the middle in either direction. Fuller, as
shown in the sketch, on the first end, to a depth of
1 in. Heat the piece and fuller the other end to a
depth of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. (A). The centre lug is now 2 ins.
long. To make this 2 ins. long it is necessary that
the fuller be placed on the piece on the outside of
the centre-punch marks. Draw out the two ends,
as shown by the sketch, one being directly opposite
the other. Punch a hole with the eye punch
in the middle of this lug almost through on one side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Take the punch out, turn the piece upside down, and
finish punching the hole. The punch used for doing
this part of the work should be straight and tapered
and quite thin on the end. The problem is not to
cut out a large piece but rather to split the metal.
It's only <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. wide and will not allow for the cutting
away of any material. A punch of this kind will
heat up on the end while driving, when it is apt to
bend. To avoid this keep it cold by dipping it
into water from time to time. Place a little green
coal in the hole after you have started the punch in.
This prevents its sticking in the hole and it also prevents
the end of the punch from getting hot. A
very deep, narrow slot can be punched successfully
in this way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_349.jpg" width="500" height="99" alt="Hole for drift pin" />
</div>

<p>The drift pin used to shape the eye upon should
be made the size of the finished hole&mdash;that is, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times;
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. and 6 ins. long&mdash;oval-shaped, and tapered on
the small end to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. This taper should be
the whole length of the drift pin. Drive the pin
into the hole about half way down. This widens
the hole so that it can now be placed on the horn of
the anvil and fullered to the required thickness, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
should be <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. on the extreme edge of the eye.
Drive the drift pin again about 4 ins. or 5 ins. At
the same time
work the metal
down on the outside.
Repeat this
till the hole fits the
drift pin. The pin
is now driven in
through from the other side, thus making both
outside openings of the eye the same size. The
hoe is now finished up as
shown in the sketch and
ready for hardening and
tempering.</p>

</div>

<p>This is done in the same
way as you did the chisel
and the same temper colour
is used for both. Five pounds is considered
about the right weight for a hoe of this kind. The
problem of working out the eye for this is the same
as for making the eyes of picks, hatchets, and tools

<p>Turnbuckles, made either of steel or iron, are
used for truss rods. There are many ways of making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
turnbuckles. Out of all, three methods are here
given: (1) Solid forged buckle, (2) welding up,
(3) pipe method.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Solid forged buckle:</i> This is made of soft steel.
Select a piece of 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. square stock 6 ins. long.
Mark off 2 ins. with a centre-punch on each end.
Draw the ends out 1 in. round. Bend the ends
down as shown
at <i>B</i>. Forge the
buckle part to 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
in. round at the
end, as shown at
<i>C</i>. Make the
other end just
like this one and weld the two ends together so
that the total length will be 10 ins. Now drill
holes in each end for a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. tap. Tap a right-hand
thread in one end and a left-hand thread
in the other end, or you can put a swivel hook in
one end in place of the thread. To do this the hole
should be drilled <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. without a thread. Select
a piece of <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. round soft steel 10 ins. long. Upset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
the end and work a tapered round head on as
shown at <i>D</i>. The head should be 1 in. long and
large enough to work loosely
in the slot. Put this into the
hole with the head between
the wings and point the end forming it into a hook.</p>

<div class="caption">Welded turnbuckle: To be welded at arrow point</div>
</div>

<p><i>Second method:</i> This is done by welding the two
rods to collars. Make two collars out of wrought
iron, the size depending upon the size of the turnbuckle.
Scrape the ends of this flat iron, bend each
into a circle, and weld on the horn of the anvil, thus
making two collars. The arm should be drawn out
of a piece of flat iron and made half round by a
swage on the anvil. This leaves the original thickness
of the bar on each end of the piece drawn out.
These ends are now flattened and scraped as shown
at <i>A</i> and should be wrenched to lap on the inside
of the collars. Place one collar on one end and the
wings opposite each other. Push a bar of iron into
the opening within an inch of the collar. This bar
prevents the tongs from squeezing the two wings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
out of shape and loosening up the collar while
welding. Grasp the turnbuckle with a pair of
tongs and place the end in the fire. Take a welding
heat and weld this down on the horn of the anvil.
At the same time shape it as shown at <i>B</i>. Draw
out the piece of iron, place the other collar in the
open end, and weld it as you did the first. This is
finished up in the holes made. Threads can be cut
or swivel hooks can be placed in.</p>

<p><i>Third method:</i> Take a piece of pipe, length and
size desired. Heat one end and upset it, enlarging
and thickening it slightly. Cut a round iron plug
to fit this end tightly. Heat the plug and drive it
into the pipe. Place it on the fire and weld the pipe
to the plug. At the same time forge the end square
or hexagonal. Drill a hole in this end, pin the swivel
hook same as explained in the second method.
Select the iron, make the head on the rod, and put
it through the pipe into the hole, head inside, before
the plug is welded in the other end. Be sure that
this rod will turn freely. Shape the hook before the
plug is welded in the 2-in. end. This gives one an
opportunity to push a rod into the pipe and hold
the head of the hook while shaping it in the form of
a hook or eye as required.</p>

<p>Now weld a plug in the other end the same as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
you did in the first. Drill a hole in this end and cut
a thread to receive the truss rod end. This last
method is much simpler than the other two. It
has this advantage, that the thread will not rust
so quickly, since it is always enclosed in the pipe.
However, there is danger of a very weak spot right
back of the plug, because you know when two pieces
of metal are welded together the temperature should
be the same. If not, the cold one will cut into the
hot one and form cold shuts. In this case it is impossible
to get the plug the same temperature as
the outside. As a consequence there is a defect in
the forging.</p>

<div class="caption">Eccentric strap</div>
</div>

<p><i>Eccentric strap:</i> The principles applied in the
working out of this problem are used in making
many articles of wrought iron. Eccentric straps are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
much used in foundries, machine shops, and general
shop work.</p>

<p><i>Stock:</i> Bar of wrought iron or soft steel 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> ins.
square, 16 ins. or 20 ins. long.</p>

<p>Round the bar down on one end to 1 in. in diameter.
Split the other end up the length of the bar 8 ins.
to within 1 in. of the shoulder made by the rounding
down of the stock. These two arms are now
thrown at right angles to the stem, forged down
to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 1 in. the entire length. The arc of the
circle made by the arms is determined by the size
of the thing the eccentric strap is meant to fit
when it is finished. The ends are now turned up at
right angles and are bent to fit the circle. A gouge
chisel will cut the end off rounding. All ladle
handles can be made in this way.</p>

<p><i>Garden hoe:</i> The drawing shows the form and
dimensions of the hoe, a garden tool very simple in
construction and very useful.</p>

<div class="caption">Hoe</div>
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Mark off 2 ins. at one end and cut
down 1 in. deep on both edges. Cut out a wedge-shaped
piece as shown in the sketch. Draw out the
piece <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. in diameter and 6 ins. long. This
forms the handle. Fuller down on each side of the
handle where it joins the body as shown by the full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
lines. With the fuller spread out the metal on either
side of the handle until it forms a blade 8 &times; 5 ins.
This blade should be <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. thick at the top and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.
at the cutting edge. Bend the handle into shape.
File or grind the
edges of the
blade to make it
smooth. This
should be tempered
by heating
it red hot.
Plunge into oil.
Take it out when cold and hold it over the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
until the oil flashes off. Then allow it to cool in
the air. Grind it and polish if a bright finish is required.
If not it is now ready for the wood handle.</p>

<p><i>Wood chisel:</i> Chisels for cutting wood can be
made from a piece of gas pipe and a piece of steel,
or from old cold chisels too short for use. If no
piece of old tool steel is at hand take a new piece,
<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 4 ins., hexagonal.</p>

<p>If a piece of gas pipe is used, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in., heat one end
and place it on the point of the horn of the anvil.
With the peen hammer thin the point down around
the end. This thinning stretches the metal and
gives you a funnel-shaped opening, and a scarf to
use for welding. The short chisel end should be
pushed into this for about 1 in. and the scarf should
be tapped down gently on this chisel. Sometimes
it is necessary to upset the end of the chisel in order
to make it fit the scarf. If required to do this,
put it into the fire and heat it red hot, and upset it
on the end where the weld is to be. Now put it
into the pipe, put borax on the scarf, and heat it
hot enough to weld. Take it out and weld it up in
a bottom swage and reduce the weld to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. in
diameter. Cut the shank off about 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. from the
weld and heat this end again. Stretch it on this
end so as to enlarge it to fit the wood handle which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
will be placed in later. Heat the steel end. Flatten
it down to the shape of a wood chisel, the width to
be according to the size needed. Out of this piece
of steel a chisel <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in., <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in., or 1 in. can be made.
It should be tapered down <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. on the cutting edge.
File the cutting edge on the chisel. It gives a much
better finish. The chisel is hardened and tempered
almost the length of the whole blade, a blue colour,
by heating it red hot, plunging it into water, polishing,
and drawing the temper on a hot piece of iron.
The handle is made by using what is known as a
hollow auger. This shapes the wood to fit the pipe.
A piece of the same pipe can be sawed off with a
hack saw about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. wide. This makes an iron
ring, which should be driven in the end of the wood
handle to prevent it from splitting. These chisels
make the best kind of tools for rough, heavy work.</p>

<p><i>Door hasp:</i> Door hasps are found most commonly
on barn doors and gates, and in conjunction with
a staple and lock form a complete fastening. The
drawings make clear the different steps in the work.</p>

<a id="i_359a"></a><img src="images/i_359a.jpg" width="600" height="258" alt="Shaping hasp" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> The eye is made first. Heat the
piece red hot. Fuller down the stick <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. from one
end, and 2 ins. from the fullered mark put in another.
The distance between the fullered marks should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
2 ins. Draw out the space between the fullered
marks to <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. in width, 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. long. Cut the corners
off the piece left on the end, as shown by the
drawing. Round this up with the hammer on the
anvil. Punch a hole in the middle of the eye, but
keep the thickness the same during all the work.
To make the body of the piece, where the slot is,
2 ins. from the shoulder fuller the end down to <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in.
from the end. Draw out this end to 1<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. in length.
This forms the loop, and at the same time it tapers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
to a sharp end. (See <a href="#i_359a">drawing</a>.) The piece is now
ready for punching. Mark places for the punch
holes, then cut between the holes with a hot chisel.
In this way the centre piece is cut out, forming the
slot. If this is carefully done little work will be
required to finish it. The slot is filed out if any rough
places are left. The end is bent up. Sometimes
a ring is put in it, as a door pull, and sometimes the
latch itself is used for the pull.</p>

<div class="caption">Dividers</div>
</div>

<p><i>Pair of dividers:</i> Perhaps the simplest way to
make a pair of dividers is to get a pair of buggy top
joint butts, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. size. Weld to each of the legs a
piece of steel to form the two legs for the dividers.
Begin about 1 in. back of the weld and draw the
legs out tapering, octagonal in shape and rounding
toward extreme sharp points. Place a washer on
each side of the joint, and rivet the ends together
with a steel rivet. If carefully done the dividers
will require no wings. If wings are required they
can be made by punching a slot <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. in each
of the legs, 2 ins. from the joint. In each of
these slots drill holes, in one a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. hole and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
other a hole for a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. tap. Drill both sets of holes
through the legs. Tap out the one and make a
thumb screw to fit. This is done by drawing out a
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. stem on the end of a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. rod and cutting
off <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. of this to form the head
of the thumb screw. Heat this
end and flatten down. Finish up
with a few strokes of the file. Cut
a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. thread on the end. Screw
it into the dividers. Draw out a wing <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.
wide, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. thick, to fit the slot. Bend it into
a semicircle and place it into the slot. Open
the dividers. See that it swings round on this
circle. Drill a small hole in the end of the wing
to fit the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. hole drilled into the leg and rivet it
into the slot. This makes a pair of dividers that
can be used for all classes of work.</p>

<h4>STONE CHISELS AND PICKS</h4>

<p>1. <i>Stone chisels:</i></p>

<p><i>Stock:</i> <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>, <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. octagonal steel, 5 ins.
long. Stone chisels are made out of the above
sizes of steel, in sets, for the cutting of marble, sandstone,
granite, etc.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Put one end of the stock in fire.
Heat about 1 in. Draw this hot end to a taper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. at the small end and 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. long. Place the
extreme end again in the fire, take it out and strike
it on the end by placing it upright on the anvil.
Upset this end and form the round top shown in
the drawing. If this top is not completed in one
heating, heat it again and repeat the hammering
on the end. All stone chisels are made with this
rounding end so that wood mallets can be used for
driving purposes. The ones shown here are the
shapes used on most stone chisels.</p>

<div class="caption">Stone chisels</div>
</div>

<p>The size of the teeth depends upon the hardness
or softness of the material to be cut. The large
teeth are used for hard stone cutting and the
small teeth for soft stone cutting. Place the other
end of the tool in the fire and flatten it down as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
shown in the sketch given here. Notice the dotted
lines show that the extreme cutting edge of this tool
is narrower than the body. This is an allowance
made for the spreading out of the tool while cutting
the teeth. Space off the teeth with a 3-cornered
file as shown in the same sketch, and cut the teeth
with a chisel made in the following way: Take a
piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. octagonal
steel. Draw it out in the
shape of a cape chisel. (See
<a href="#i_363">sketch</a>.) Heat the end of
the steel tool, then place
it in the vise. With the
end projecting up place the
chisel on the mark made
by the file, strike down
sharply on the chisel, and
drive it down to the required
depth. This is repeated
until the teeth are all cut. Flatten the
cutting edge carefully on the anvil, and all teeth
that may have been driven out of a straight line by
the cutting. Heat the tool to soften it. File
between the teeth the roughness made by the forging
of the tool. A small flat jewellers' file will be found
best for this purpose. Harden the tool as you did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
the cold chisel, and temper it at the purple colour
sign.</p>

<p>2. <i>Pick:</i></p>

<p><i>Stock:</i> <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. square tool steel, 8 ins.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_364.jpg" width="350" height="163" alt="Pick" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Mark the middle of the bar with a
centre-punch. Punch the hole through with the
eye punch. Put in
a drift pin and flatten
down the bulged
sides of the bar made
by punching the
hole. Draw the two ends out to a sharp square point.
This should make the pick not more than 10 ins.
long. The drawing should show the shape it will
be when finished. These picks are hardened the
same as cold chisels, and tempered at the purple
colour.</p>


<h4>ROCK DRILLS (USED WITH MACHINERY)</h4>

<p>As the name indicates, these drills are used for
making holes in rocks when blasting is to be done.
The form and shapes most in use are shown here.</p>

<p>The double drill, used so much in power drilling
machines, is made in the following way: Take a
1-in. octagonal bar of steel, any length. Heat one
end, and upset it to 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter. Put a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
small <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. fuller on the anvil and place the end of
the bar lengthwise on the fuller. Put the top
fuller directly above this and strike with a sledge
hammer. The result is two fuller marks driven
down within <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. of meeting. Reverse this and
do the same on the other two sides. This marks a
cross.</p>

<img src="images/i_365a.jpg" width="600" height="176" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Machine drill</div>
</div>

<p>Place the forming tool in the anvil, and with a
set hammer forge out the wings as shown in the
sketch. The diameter of the drill depends upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
size of the hole to be drilled and is made accordingly.
Use a sharp chisel for cutting the cutting edges of
the drill. It is now ready for tempering. Drills
are made in this way from the raw material. When
once made they are kept in shape by what is known
as the drill dressing tool shown here. These rock
drills wear out on the sides, thus reducing the diameter.
When re-dressing they are always upset
to the required diameter. The re-dressing is done
in the following way: Heat the end of the drill
in the fire and place the dressing tool so that the
cross impression fits the end of the drill. Drive on
the end lengthwise of the bar, upsetting the drill
to the required diameter, at the same time retaining
the original shape of the cutting edge of
the drill.</p>

<p><i>To temper rock drills:</i> Take two small tubs of
cold water, one clear and the other made soapy by
cutting up a bar of cheap soap into bits. Heat the
end of the drill to be tempered to a dull red and put
it into the tub of clear water, the cutting edge only
under water until it is cooled off. Take it out to
polish. When the straw colour appears plunge it
into the tub of soapy water. This does away with
any red heat that might be in the bar when the
temper colours appear. Soapy water is a poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
conductor of heat and it allows the steel to cool off
without suddenly chilling it.</p>


<h4>DRILL FOR HAND DRILLING</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="i_367"></a><img src="images/i_367.jpg" width="500" height="106" alt="Drill " />
</div>

<p>These drills are used for drilling holes in rocks
where it is impossible to place machines or where
machines are not available, such as on farms, where
great rocks and nigger heads are to be removed by
drilling and blasting out.</p>

<p>They are made as you would make a cold chisel.
The taper, however, is much shorter and the ends
are usually either rounded or diamond shape.
(See <a href="#i_367">sketch</a>.) The cutting edges are ground, but
in many cases they are forged and filed to shape.
They are tempered in the same way as cold chisels
are treated.</p>

<div class="caption">Pipe drill</div>
</div>

<p><i>Round and flat hand drill:</i> Take a piece of
octagonal steel, the size and length depending upon
the size and depth of the hole to be drilled. These
should not be over 20 ins. in length, for the blow
would have little effect upon the cutting edge of the
drill. Put one end into the fire, take it out and
finish it up as you would the short end of a cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
chisel. Reverse the piece of steel, and heat this
end, for about two inches, red hot. Place it on the
side of the anvil face and flatten it down tapering.
Make it very short and just wide enough for the
size hole to be drilled. With a hot chisel cut the
end into the proper shape, either round or diamond
shape. With the hand hammer work the cutting
edge on the end. This end should be from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.
to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. in thickness. Either file or grind the bevel
which forms the cutting edge sharp. Harden and
temper it the same as you would a cold chisel.
If it is found, on trial, to be too soft, re-heat, harden,
and temper at a higher colour. One of the best
hand drills for drilling holes in soft material like
bricks or sandstones is a piece of gas pipe any
length. File teeth in the end, like a saw tooth. Case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
harden the end. This drill will go through a wall almost
as quickly as a twist drill and with much less
labour.</p>


<h4>SHACKLE</h4>

<p>Shackles are used for connecting chains, wire,
ropes, etc.</p>

1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. (for key). One piece <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. round iron,
2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. (for ring).</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Heat the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. round iron bar two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
inches, then bend this end on the anvil at right
angles to the rest of the bar. Place the heel on the
anvil, with the end sticking up. Strike on the end
with the hand hammer and drive it down into the
heel of the piece. Repeat on the other end of the
bar. As one can always force the metal into
any shape one desires by first driving it one
way or the other, skill in making the two ends
of the bar depends upon one's way of using
the hammer. This method of making the eye
on the end of the bar does away with welding and
upsetting of the metal. A round finished eye
is the result of the natural bending of the metal.
This holds good not only for the shackles like this
one but for many other tools, such as hand holds for
cars, wagons, etc.</p>

<p><i>Bending:</i> The shackle should be bent as shown
in the sketch. First bend it right back of the eye,
each one at about 45&deg;. Heat the body of the piece
and shape it around the horn of the anvil until the
opening measures 1 in. wide. The sledge and swage
are best used for this purpose. Place the swage
on the metal and have the helper strike the swage.
The shape is not apt to be changed or the metal
marred if these tools are used.</p>

<p><i>Pin:</i> Take the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 4 in. piece of stock. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
end is heated and upset about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. Place this
end in a heading tool and work a button head
on the end with either the cupping tool or
a hand hammer. The pin should have a slot
cut through it 2 ins. from the head. To do this
make a punch to cut the slot the shape required.
After the piece is marked punch the slot by driving
the punch half way through on one side. Turn the
piece over and drive the hole through on the
other side. This enlarges the metal a little. Reduce
it to the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. size to fit the hole in the
shackle. Cut a little piece of iron the thickness and
width of the key, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. long. Heat the end with
the hole in and drive this drift into the slot. With
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. top and bottom swage and the drift in
the slot, reduce the pin to fit the hole. Drive
the drift out. You now have a nice rounded
pin with a hole in, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.</p>

<p><i>Key:</i> Take a piece of 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. flat iron or steel.
Mark the shape of the key. Cut it out and file
to fit the slot. Drill holes in the small end of this
to prevent it falling out of the pin.</p>

<p><i>Ring:</i> Bend the piece of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. wire around a
<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. rod in the shape of a spiral and saw off each
ring as required. The ring should fit the hole in
the key. This method of making a shackle is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
same whether the material is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter or
any size up to 2 ins. in diameter.</p>


<h4>CROW-BARS, AND WELDING OF TOOL STEEL TO
WROUGHT IRON</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="i_372"></a><img src="images/i_372.jpg" width="400" height="85" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Crow-bar</div>
</div>

<p>Crow-bars are made by welding a piece of round
No. 2 flat steel into the end of a wrought iron bar
any length or any size, depending upon the use to
which the bar is to be put when made. This drawing
shows a bar for shifting rails for railroads.
When the size is determined, select the wrought
iron to be used. Upset the end and split it with a
chisel <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. for a cleft weld. Re-heat the end to
a white heat. Place it upon the edge of the anvil
nearest you and with the peen of the hammer work
the scarf out to a sharp point. Repeat on the other
side. (See <a href="#i_372">picture</a>.) Place the piece of steel selected
for welding, in the fire; shape this end down to
a sharp point at an angle of 45&deg;. With the edge
of the chisel placed on this scarf, strike on the top
of the chisel with a sledge hammer. This will
cut a nick and at the same time it raises up a sliver
which will help hold the piece of steel in the iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
between the cleft. Cool this scarf off in water until
it is black hot. Heat the piece of iron (scarf end).
Place the end of the steel scarf between the cleft
and close the scarf on to the steel by striking gently.
The steel will now stay in the end of the piece until it
is welded. Place the scarf in the fire and when it is
red hot cover it with borax. Get a welding heat on
the wrought iron close to the joint first. Gradually
work this heat toward the steel till the borax
begins to burn, emitting a dark brown smoke. Take
it out of the fire and place it on the anvil. One or
two sharp blows on the end of the steel will drive it up
into the crotch of the scarf. Now strike gently on
the top of the scarf. Increase the force of the blows
when you are sure the two pieces are welding together.
If the pieces are not welding, which will be readily
seen by the points of the scarf opening while working
them down, place them again in the fire, put on borax
and re-heat. A few trials will teach you how hot to
get it for welding. Flatten down the end and shape
it as shown in the drawing. Harden and temper
the crow-bar as you would a cold chisel. If the
point is not quite sharp enough grind it on the stone.</p>


<h4>NAIL PULLER OR CLAW TOOL</h4>

<p>This tool is made in much the same way as you
make a crow bar. However, before bending the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
end up into a crow-bar shape, cut a slot in the end,
as shown in the picture. Now bend it into shape.
The handle should not be over 20 ins. in length and
tapered usually from <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. at the large end to about
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. at the smaller end. The end is now flattened
and a hole punched in it to hang it up when not in
use. This is one of the handiest tools to have
around any shop, not only as a nail and a bolt
puller, but it may be used in place of the crow-bar.
The drawing explains the various steps in the
making of the tool.</p>

<h4>BUTCHER KNIFE</h4>

<div class="caption">Butcher knife detail</div>
</div>

<p>The spring steel used for carving knives or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
steel used for that purpose should be a grade that
will harden in oil just hard enough to feel a mill-cut
file cut the steel. Cut the stock off 9 ins.
and forge the shank first. On this size steel this
forging of the shank consists in reducing the thickness
of the material and widening it about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in.
to 2 ins. in length. This tends to toughen the steel,
and it makes a better knife by this extra work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="i_375"></a><img src="images/i_375.jpg" width="600" height="305" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Butcher knives</div>
</div>

<p>To forge the blade, heat 7 ins. and bend it a little
edgewise before reducing the one side for cutting
edge. Allow the stretching and thinning out of
this edge to straighten the blade, and the curve on
the back will form itself, naturally, by the extra
length of the cutting edge. Do not try to forge the
exact shape of the knife. It is much better to reduce
it to the required thickness, outline the shape, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
cut it with a hot or cold chisel. At this thickness
the knife can be worked either hot or cold when
doing this particular kind of work. Cut along
the outline, thus giving it shape. A fine file will
finish the roughness on the outline and trim up any
uneven spots caused by the shaping. When the
knife is finished, so far as the forging is concerned,
anneal it by heating the whole blade and allowing
it to cool in slaked lime. This relieves any strain
due to forging. Handles are made of bone, birch,
or beech, and can be shaped to suit one's taste.
They should measure about 1 &times; <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 5 ins. Rivets
hold them in place. (See <a href="#i_375">cut</a>.) These are of brass
wire, easily made by cutting off the length required
to go through the wood to hold the blade in place.
Place the blade in the slot of the wood handle and
drill four holes through the wood and through the
blade. Do not make the holes more than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in.
in diameter. Take the blade out, harden, and temper.
All drilling of holes and fitting should be done before
the blade is tempered, while it is in the soft state.
It is difficult to drill the holes after the tempering
has been done.</p>

<p><i>To temper the blade:</i> The blade is tempered by
heating it on a coke fire. Place the back of the
blade down, on a piece of flat iron. The iron will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
heat red hot. The iron under the knife prevents
the flame striking the blade and heating it unevenly,
in spots, as it were. When the blade is red hot
plunge it into a bath made of linseed oil. Take it
out of the oil and polish it. Use the piece of iron
the blade was heated on to draw the temper. This
hot iron is put on the anvil, the back of the knife
edgewise is placed on the iron and moved forward
and backward to insure a uniform heat. As soon
as the straw colour appears take out any buckle
or bend caused by the hardening. Place the other
side of the blade on the anvil. A few quick, sharp
blows with the peen of the hammer will straighten
the blade. Continue the tempering until the purple
colour shows. The blade should be tempered so
that a very smooth, sharp file will just cut it when
rubbed over the surface. Place the blade in the
handle and rivet it in place, polish it, and then
grind.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> handling of wrought iron when making
ornamental work often brings in, besides the
usual smithing operations, the processes of
embossing, impressing, engraving, etching, inlaying
of copper or brass, grinding, and polishing. Embossing
is done by heating the piece and raising the
metal from the back into an iron above the surface.</p>

<p>Impressing is done by cutting an impression in an
iron block and driving the metal into it.</p>

<p>Engraving consists of putting the design upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
iron with a diamond point chisel or any sharp tool,
with the aid of a hammer. When the design is
cut out by means of acid the process is called etching.
It is done in this way: The surface to be etched is
first covered with a layer of wax. The design to
be left is scratched through the wax into the metal
by using a very sharp tool. This lays bare the
surface of the metal to be etched. The acid or
etching fluid is then applied. When sufficiently
etched the acid is removed from the surface of the
metal by means of turpentine. This stops the action
of the acid immediately.</p>

<p>Inlaying is hammering one metal into the surface
of another. It is done by cutting a groove in the
surface of one metal and hammering the other
metal into this groove.</p>

<p>Impressing, engraving, etching, inlaying, etc.,
are used on fine pieces of ornamental work, such as
door knockers, drawer pulls, door handles, sword
blades, ornamental hinges, fire sets, etc., or on
small pieces of work such as initials or coats of arms,
etc.</p>

<p><i>Splitting of iron or soft steel:</i> Splitting iron or
soft steel is done for many pieces of work. All
solid rings, rings without welds, handles for carrying
ladles in foundries of all kinds are made in this way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>Most of our ornamental work, where we require
two pieces of iron running from a stem in opposite
directions, calls for this process.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We are now going to make a pair of andirons.
The process of splitting iron comes in with this
problem.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_385.jpg" width="600" height="349" alt="Andirons" />
</div>

<p><i>Pair of andirons:</i> It is always best to make a
sketch of the large pieces of ornamental work to
be made, in order that they may have the proper
proportion to their setting and bear the right relation
to their surroundings. For instance, a grill made
from either wrought iron or soft steel must fit the
opening when finished, iron gates must fit space for
which they are intended, yet not be too tall or too
short to be in good proportion to their setting, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Andirons must fit into the fireplace and occupy
the space so as to give the eye a sense of fitness
and proportion to the whole hearth. This sketch
shows a pair of andirons that can be made suitable
for any size hearth. No inlaying, etching, etc.,
is used upon this work, the only decoration being
the hammer marks left by the peen of the hammer.
Andirons are much used in country homes where log
fires are in use. They can be made of iron or brass,
and coal or wood may be used on a hearth fitted
out with a pair.</p>

<p><i>Stock:</i> One piece soft steel, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 20 ins.
Two pieces, <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. square, 9 ins. long. Two pieces,

square, 20 ins. long. One piece <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. square iron.
One piece 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 6 ins. flat iron.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_387.jpg" width="500" height="376" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Bend in this way to form the legs</div>
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Take the 20-in. bar and split it
10 ins. To do this rub a piece of chalk on the two
faces of the bar. This makes clear any marking
put on the surface. With the square mark off
10 ins. from one end. Now with a pair of dividers
set at <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. run along the bar with one leg of the
dividers on the outer edge to the 10-in. mark. Do
this on both faces. Now mark on this centre line
with a cold chisel. Put the bar into the fire and
heat the end of it. Take it out when red hot and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
put it on the anvil. The marks made by the cold
chisel will show plainly. With the hot chisel
cut along the lines made by the cold chisel, cutting
from both sides of the piece until the bar is divided
into two equal parts. This will require a number
of heatings to do. The last inch should be cut
from the top down. To cut this, up-end the bar
on the anvil or any solid base, placing the hot
chisel in the crotch of the piece and striking it with
the sledge hammer. This cuts the last inch down
square with the axis of the bar. The sledge hammer
work is heavy and one requires a helper here.
The bar is now divided into two wings. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
shaping these two wings into the base for feet the
upper part of the bar should be drawn out according
to the drawing and the end rounded or squared as
suits the taste. The wings are now shaped up and
form the two feet on the bar. (See <a href="#i_388">drawing</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="i_388"></a><img src="images/i_388.jpg" width="600" height="166" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Shape legs should be before bending</div>
</div>

<p><i>To shape the feet of the andiron:</i> The drawing
shows the shape and length the legs should be. To do
this heat the bar at the crotch, and flatten both sides
out almost straight. This prepares for shaping
according to the drawing. Measure off 3 ins.
from the extreme end of each leg and mark off
with a centre-punch. The 3-in. lengths form the
feet. Taper the iron between the centre-punch
mark and the crotch so that when finished the leg
should measure 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. close to the crotch,
and 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. at the centre-punch mark. Repeat
this on the other leg. Flatten out the feet so that
they will measure 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. These feet are
slightly impressed. To do this place the feet over
a hollow iron block and force the metal down so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
that the under side is raised up about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. above the
level of the foot. (See dotted lines on the <a href="#i_388">drawing
of the feet</a>.) Repeat on the other side.</p>

<p>The leg is now ready to be bent into shape. Heat
up at the crotch and then bend both legs back toward
the top end at an angle of 60&deg;. Heat again
and bend the legs forward, shaping them like the
drawing.</p>

<p><i>Back part of the andiron:</i> The drawing shows a
short upright piece placed so as to prevent the
logs rolling out in front. The 14-in. piece is welded
on to the upright, as shown in the drawing, and
fastened on to the andiron. The 20-in. piece is
welded on to the andiron and forms the leg on which
the wood is placed. These pieces are welded upon
short uprights by what is called jump welds. (See
description of <a href="#Page_259">jump welds</a>.) The end of the iron is
bent on the anvil as square bends are always made.
(See description of square bends.) The end that
fastens to the andiron proper is also bent square,
but tapered slightly to make a nice fit. Fastening
the frame to the andiron is done with a stud and
bolt. The stud is screwed into the andiron and into
the frame as shown by the dotted lines. A square
headed bolt fastens the upper part, thus preventing
any twisting out of place. The only finish given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
to the andirons is that left by the marking of this
peen hammer. This leaves a mottled surface,
which gives an old look to the finished piece.</p>

<p><i>Chain ring bolt:</i> Ring bolt is made from a
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. square iron piece. This is drawn down at
one end until it is 1 in. long and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. round. A
thread is cut on this end. Drill a hole through the
centre of the square head <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. in diameter.</p>

<p><i>Ring:</i> Take the 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 6 in. piece of flat iron.
Draw it out so that it tapers toward each end. (See
<a href="#i_390">drawing</a>.) On the extreme end of each is a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in.
pin <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. long. Bend ring into shape. The lower
centre of the ring has a knob. This knob is made
out of a piece of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. square iron pulled down <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
in. in diameter and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. back from the end. The
fullered end makes the pin and should be cut long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
enough to project through the ring <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. to allow
for riveting. You have sufficient stock to round
up on the edge of the anvil into a ball shape. Drill
a hole in the centre of the ring and fit the pin on
the end of the knob into the hole in the ring. Rivet
tight. The design you see on the ring may be put
on with a diamond pointed chisel. The ring is
now heated, opened out, and pushed into the hole
made in the ring bolt so that it swings easily into
place. Two rings of course should be made. The
chain fastened from one ring to another is used as a
guard against fire. The chain rings are made out
of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. square iron which is cut 10 ins. long. Then
they are bent square and welded as chain links
are usually welded. Notice that the last two links
show an opening just wide enough to allow them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
to be slipped into the rings of the andiron. This
completes the set. The finish is made by the indentations
left by the peen of the hammer.</p>

<p>On page 369 is shown another pair of andirons.
They are made in the same way as the pair just
described, splitting it down to form the legs.
The wood rests are
riveted through the body
of the piece, forming a
large rivet head in front
to hold it in place and
at the same time adding
to the decoration.</p>

open hearth fires of
either coal or wood.
They are always in
evidence in country
homes where open fireplaces are still in use.
They can be made of brass, iron, or soft steel. If
an andiron is in place the fire tools are usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
made of the same metal and finished in the same

<p><i>Stock:</i> One piece <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. of round stock fullered
down <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. from the end to a thickness of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.
Knock the four corners down and round up into a
ball. Five inches from this, fuller the piece to
<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. thickness. Draw the piece out any length,
keeping the thickness <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. Weld the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. rod
to the small end. The extreme end of the poker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
may be finished in various ways. It is sometimes
turned at right angles to the rod. It may
be pointed, flattened, etc. The centre of the handle
is slightly curved. To do
this heat the rod and reduce
it, then place it upon the
largest part of the horn of
the anvil. With the hand
hammer, hammer until the
thinnest part in the centre
measures about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in
diameter. In this way the
handle is reduced <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. at
that point, and curved in
slightly.</p>

the shovel blade. To do this, upset the extreme
end of the rod back about 1 in. and about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in
diameter. Flatten this out and shape it up as
shown by the sketch. Holes are drilled in for <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.
rivets.</p>

<p><i>Shovel blade:</i> Cut a paper pattern just the shape
of the blade. Mark on the inside of the pattern
the width of the edges to be turned up. Place the
paper pattern on the metal and cut out the outline
with a cold chisel. Now mark off the inside line
for the turned up edges. Heat the metal in the
forge fire, a little at a time, beginning at the centre
part of the round. Bend it upon a round stake,
tapping gently with the hammer until the blade
is well shaped, according to your design. This
size metal will buckle up the same as the copper
did. Give as much care in rounding up the iron
as you did to the copper. (See <a href="#III">copper bowl</a>.) When
the piece has taken on the shovel shape place the
end of the handle to be riveted on the blade, and
mark the holes. Drill and rivet the handle and the
blade with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. round head iron rivets. Notice
that the shovel blade is not in an exact line with
the handle and rod. It forms an angle with them.
This bend is made after the riveting is done. Heat
the piece where the blade joins the rod and bend it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
back gently either with the hand or by tapping it
with a hammer, keeping the hot part of the shovel,
all the time, on the horn of the anvil.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Make handle as for
poker and shovel. Look at the detail
drawing and you will see by the
dotted lines that 2 ins. from the
lower end of the handle the stock is
bent out at right angles to the axis
of the handle. Take one of the
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 16 in. round rods, place it
in the swage, using the top swage
on this. Shape the piece between
the two swages. Form it to an
oval shape by striking with a sledge
hammer on the top swage. This
makes one half of the rounded part
of the tong. If this is done without
turning the piece while working it, the cross
section will be oval. Bend it rounding, as shown
by the drawing. It is now ready to weld to the
rod, but before doing this it is best to finish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
hinge. Draw out the stock between the shoulder
and the bend, 2 &times; <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> ins. in diameter. Leave the
stock heavy near the handle on account of the
weight of the tongs.
To form the hinge:
Place a round <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in.
punch, flattened on
the end, on the
corner and drive
down half way. This makes a circular depression,
just large enough to accommodate the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in.
hinge. Two of these wings of the tongs are to
be made to complete the tongs. The second piece
is far simpler than the first to make, and it is
really the only part of the tong that moves. Draw
out the stock and make the same size oval as
you made with the other piece under the swages.
Bend it the same
shape. Repeat the
work with the punch
on the end, thus making
the other half of
the tong hinge. File
these halves to fit perfectly. When that is satisfactory,
drill a hole through the middle. Put
a round-head rivet through, and see whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
the hinge now works perfectly free. Remove
rivets. The parts are now ready to be welded
to the rods. Upset the ends of the small rods,
scarf both for a regular lap weld (see <a href="#Page_258">Lap Weld</a>),
and finish by welding. The end of the tongs are
flattened down. Flatten out the material and at the
same time round it up. If the material is not thick
enough to give enough for this rounding part, upset
the end a little, or double the end over and weld.
(See <a href="#Page_247">Welding</a>.)</p>

<p>Tongs are now ready for riveting together.
Place the hinge in position. Push the round-head
rivet through the hole made. Let it push through
far enough to allow material for a rivet head of
exactly the size of the round head. The head may
be rounded up if not too large, while it is cold.
Since only a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. rivet is called for here, this work
can be done without any heating.</p>

<p>Tongs are made, as you know, for the purpose of
picking up pieces of wood or coal to place them in a
stove or open fire. One must keep their use in
mind when making the ends of the tongs fitted
to do this work, so the ends may be flat, round,
claw shaped, concaved, etc. The finish will be
the same as the finish on the andiron, without
any attempt at ornament. The surface should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
show the hammer marks, but be quite free from
lumps.</p>

<p><i>Stand:</i> Sometimes hooks are fastened in the fireplace
for holding the fire tools. A tool stand, however,
is most convenient and may be made easily.
The drawing shows a plain design, with base, feet,
upright, arms for receiving the tools, and handle.</p>

<p><i>Stock:</i> Base, No. 20 sheet iron, 18 &times; 14 ins.,
oblong piece. Feet: 3 pieces, 1 in. square, 2 ins.
long. Upright, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. round, 26 ins. long. Arms,
2 pieces, 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 15 ins. Handle, 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 20 ins.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> The drawing shows the stand as it
should look when finished. Base is made first.
Cut out a pattern of an ellipse, long diameter 18
ins., short diameter 14 ins. Place this pattern on
the oblong piece and cut it out with shears or a cold
chisel. On the inside mark off 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. parallel to
the outside edge. On that line turn the metal up
as you turned up the rim of the copper bowl. This
can be done while the metal is either hot or cold.
Perhaps it is a little easier to work up most of the
bend while the metal is hot and finish up while it
is cold. Do not cool the metal off in water,
though. This tends to harden it a little. Let it
cool off gradually, and when necessary anneal or
soften it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
<i>Feet:</i> The 1-in. square iron is fullered down 1 in.
from the end. The ball is rounded out of this end
piece same as was done in making the balls for the
door knocker. This leaves part of the metal with
which to make a pin for riveting. Cut off this rivet
pin the length required. Rivet holes are made in
the base large enough to receive the rivet pins on the
iron feet. Divide the base into three equal parts.
Drill rivet holes the right size, put the iron balls
in place, and rivet.</p>

<p><i>Arms:</i> The two pieces of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 1 &times; 15 ins. are bent
and scarfed. The two scarfed edges are welded
together. Then the end is welded to one end of
the upright post.</p>

<p><i>Handle:</i> The handle is made separate and is then
welded on to the arms. Take the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 20 in. piece
and bend it at right angles 5 ins. from each end.
Heat it in the middle and bend so the two ends
come together. This forms a loop. Make this
loop the same shape as is shown by the handle.
Weld the two 5-in. ends together, shape, and then
weld this to the crotch of the arms. This forms
the handle. The arms are now bent wide enough
to receive the fire tools.</p>

<p><i>The upright:</i> Cut it off 30 ins. from the top of
the arms. Upset one end large enough to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
foot 4 ins. long and about 2 ins. wide. This is
flattened down and shaped as shown, for three
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. rivets. Push the rivets in and rivet the upright
to the base. If the base should not be strong
enough to hold the upright firm it can be strengthened
by placing a brace from the long ends and
fastening it to the centre of the upright. This adds
to the decoration as well as the strength. Use a
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. flat bar of iron or steel. Place it in a
vise and twist it about two thirds of its length.
Bend the ends to fit the curved sides of the base
and also to fit the post. A small <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. rivet on each
side and one through the post will hold it sufficiently.
The stand is finished to correspond with the andiron
and fire tools. In this design the hammer marks
seem more suitable than any special decoration.
A little machine oil spread over the surface, the
whole thing heated in the forge fire until the oil
flashes off, gives a natural iron finish, which is most
pleasing.</p>

CANDLESTICKS, HINGES, IRON BRACKETS</small></h3>


<h4>CANDLESTICK</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> wrought iron candlestick is made up
of three pieces welded together.</p>

<p><i>Stock:</i> Three pieces of
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. round iron 4 ins. long.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_402.jpg" width="250" height="334" alt="Candlestick" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> The detail drawings
show the steps in the
making of this piece of work.
Notice that the rod used to
make the leg and foot also
forms part of the holder or
socket. Take one of the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>
&times; 4 in. rods. Mark off <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in.
from one end. Draw this out as shown by the
sketch. Mark off <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. from that point. From
this <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. mark draw the material out 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins.
long. This should be made square and tapered
slightly toward the foot. You will then have <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
in. for the foot.</p>

<p><i>Foot:</i> The drawing shows a conventional flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
shaped foot. Spread the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. wide enough to
shape a foot as shown in the sketch. Shape it
by cutting it out with a chisel and then filing. The
embossing is done in the same way, as has been explained.
(See <a href="#XXVIII">Embossing</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Socket:</i> The socket is tulip or cup shaped. Flatten
out the opposite end of the 4-in. bar and shape up
as shown in sketch. Make the other two legs to
match this one. Weld the three pieces together
at A in the following way: Put the three parts
together and bind in place with a piece of binding
wire. Place it in the fire and heat it to a welding
heat. Weld the three pieces close to the socket and
for about 1 in. below. Shape a round neck (see
<a href="#i_404">sketch</a>) and at the same time reduce it to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. in
diameter. The small iron collar is put on and welded
about 1 in. below the socket. This addition is for
ornamental purposes entirely.</p>

<p><i>Shape socket for the candle:</i> Heat the top at a
low heat and with a pair of round-nosed pincers
shape up as shown.</p>

<p>The legs are now twisted. This can be done the
last thing and while the metal is cold.</p>

<p><i>Wrought iron candlestick:</i> Take a piece of soft
steel or wrought iron <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 4 &times; 4 ins. Heat the bar.
Emboss the centre by driving it in a hole in a swage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
block. The centre should be about 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. above
the surface of the feet. Cut out the four pieces
as shown in the sketch. File up
and finish the base.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="i_404"></a><img src="images/i_404.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="Candlestick pieces" />
</div>

<p><i>Post:</i> Select a piece of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in.
square iron. Taper the ends to
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. square by 7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. long.
The small end swells out <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in.
as shown in the
sketch. Forge a
small pin, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
in., on the end of
this post. Now
swell the base of
the post so that
it will measure
<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. square. The length from
end to end minus the length of the pin should
measure 8 ins. Forge a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. pin <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. long at
the base end. Heat the centre of the post; place
it in the vise and give it a complete twist to the
right. Drill in the centre of the base a hole to fit
the pin on the end of the post. Heat the pin red
hot and rivet the base to the post.</p>

<p><i>Candle socket:</i> This socket is made in a conventional
design. Take a piece of No. 20 soft sheet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
steel or iron and cut a disc 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. in diameter.
Divide this piece equally into six parts and cut out
as shown on the drawing. Bend these leaves up to
form a socket. Now cut a piece of sheet metal
2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. square, and cut out as shown for the little
ornament fastened on the top. Bend the four wings
down as shown here. Drill a small hole through the
centre of each to fit to the piece on the end of the
post. Place these pieces in position and rivet in
place. This work is to be done cold. A candlestick
of this design is easily made and very attractive
when finished.</p>


<h4>DECORATIVE IRON WORK</h4>

<p>Next to the scroll, the twist is perhaps the most
characteristic detail of decorative treatment in iron.
Twists relieve the plain effect of the straight lines
made by the hard edges of the metal, by introducing
short curves into the design. The twists are
easily made and lend themselves largely for decoration
on such things as fire escapes, brackets, grills,
gates, fences, and smaller articles, such as umbrella
stands, door knockers, fire tools, etc.</p>

<p>The twisting is done best while the iron is cold.
If done while the iron is hot great care must be taken
to check up when the lines begin to run too close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
together. Take a bar of square iron, fasten one
end in the vise, and with a monkey wrench on the
other end give the metal a twist. Only square bars
show a change in the shape after twisting. Round
stock when placed in the vise and twisted shows
no change in shape. However, two pieces of round
stock twisted give a very pleasing effect. A
braided strand is made (1) by welding the ends of
two pieces of round iron together side by side and
twisting them, (2) welding ends of two more pieces
of the same size and length together and twisting
them, (3) by welding these two twisted bars together
on both ends and twisting them in the opposite
direction. This gives a braided effect which is
most decorative. However, the square stock gives
the most satisfactory result in all of this twisted
work.</p>

<p>Handles can be made by reducing square stock,
leaving the centre larger and drawing the ends out
to a taper and twisting this tapered part. Begin
the twist in the middle and let it rise gradually toward
each end. Great care must be taken with this
work, as the smallest sizes are also the weakest and
naturally bend first. To do this work successfully
the metal must be heated and driven a little each
time until the whole taper is twisted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
<i>Spirals:</i> Spirals are made by drawing a long
taper on the end of a round or square bar of small
iron. Turn the end of the bar up <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. at right
angles. Grasp the turned up end in the vise; coil
the end up as you would a coil of rope. Slip one
end under the other when they come together.
When the first coil reaches the centre of the piece
repeat on the other end until the two coils meet in
the middle. Heat it all evenly. Grasp both ends
in the tongs and pull the spiral out. Stop when the
openings equal the size of the iron of which the coil
is made.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_407.jpg" width="350" height="396" alt="Ornamental Bulbs" />
</div>

<p><i>Ornamental bulbs:</i>
Bulbs are used in the
same way as spirals
and twists, for decorative
purposes, on
andirons, grills, fences,
etc.</p>

<p>The form shown here
in the sketch is a very
simple one. The
principle, however, is the same as that applied
to the forging of more complex bulbs. Select
a rod of iron for a core. Reduce the thickness
to about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. for about 6 ins. long, leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
required thickness at the ends; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. from the
shoulder nick the bar around, cutting it almost
through. Leave about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. to hold it to the body
of the piece. Cut the core off 1 in. from the
3-in. cut. The picture shows the method
of making the core in order to work out
the problem. Select a number of pieces
of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. round soft steel the length of
the reduced piece and place these around
the core, each one fitting close to the next
one. If the space is too small or too large
when the last piece is put in make the
core larger or smaller. These rods should
just touch when they lie around the core.
Now with a pair of tongs bind all the rods
tightly around the core and with the same
tongs put one end in the fire and heat
red hot. Cover with borax. Take on a welding
heat and weld it in a swage, confining the length
of the welding to as short a space as
possible.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/i_408.jpg" width="100" height="499" alt="Make the core" />
</div>

<p>The core prevents the rods from sinking while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
welding and it also keeps them in place. Reverse
the piece. Put the other end in the fire and weld as
before. Weld the neck as short as possible. Heat
the body of the piece uniformly. Grasp one end
of the bar in the vise and with a pair of tongs
twist the other end toward the right slowly. While
doing so tap lightly on the end with a hammer.
This tends to loosen up the rods and help the
twisting. Be careful not to twist so much that
the rods will break away from the welds.
Heat all again. Place it again in the vise and
twist in the opposite direction, at the same
time driving on the ends. This forces the centre
out and gives it a bulb shape. The core
should bend up where the cutting is done. Now
the core should be driven out. A punch
driven in against the core should break it easily
where the cut marks are made. These short ends
are forced out through the openings between the
rods, and any uneven buckles or bends in the
rods should be bent or straightened as the case requires.
The bulb can be trued up while cold. A
punch driven through from the opposite side
will help straighten any of the rods bent from the
outside in.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_408a.jpg" width="600" height="104" alt="Use of tongs" />
</div>

<p>The rods can be plied apart with a pair of pliers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
or a pair of tongs. The surplus metal on the top
end is now cut off and trued up.</p>

<p>This old Dutch candlestick is made of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. round
wire in spiral form. The spiral stem is made so
that, as the candle burns down, an inner socket
is moved around the spiral. This travels up and
down and keeps the point of the candle above the
holder.</p>

round wire, 40 ins.</p>

<p><i>Directions (base or pan):</i> Divide the disc into
sixteen equal parts. Flute these parts by cutting
out a little hollow in a hard wood block and driving
the flutes in by the use of a round cross peen hammer.
Fluting reduces the diameter of the disc and forms
it into a pan shape.</p>

<p><i>Legs:</i> The three legs are in one piece. The
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1 &times; 5 in. piece is split down half way; 1 in.
from where the split ends the piece is fullered down.
(See <a href="#i_410">sketch</a>.) Draw out this end <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. wide. Draw
out the split ends to this width, and all pieces to
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. thickness. This forms a tripod, the three
legs at an equal distance apart. The ends of the
feet are made very thin by flattening down. Turn
these up as shown by the sketch and shape the
three feet.</p>

<p><i>Spiral stem:</i> This candle stem is <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter.
If you wind up a piece of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. wire on a
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. iron rod while the metal is cold you will have
a spiral stem like the one shown here. To do this
make a mandrel out of a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. bar not less than
20 ins. in length. Drill a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. hole in the end.
Into this hole drive a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. iron plug. Place this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
mandrel in the vise. Bend a small loop on the end
of this wire to fit the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. pin. Bend the wire and
begin to wind around the bar. Make as many turns
as are shown in the drawing. Take the wire off.
The small loop end will stick out below the spiral
and prevent it standing on a base level. This end
must be driven back. To do this place it upon the
other end of the rod, strike it with the hammer,
and flatten it out so that the base will stand flat.
Insert a sharp-pointed chisel between the coils; open
them out so that the distance between them will
be <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. Do this while the metal is cold. The
handle may be made any design. It can be bent
over, extended at right angles to the top, etc.
Rivet the legs to the base with a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. bolt. With
a nut on the end rivet tightly to prevent the nut
loosening up.</p>

<p><i>Socket to fit the spiral stem, for raising and lowering
the candle:</i> <i>Stock:</i> One piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1 &times; 3 in. One
piece of 1 &times; 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. flat iron or soft steel, No. 20.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> The No. 20 piece is bent around a
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. mandrel to give it a cylindrical shape. The
two edges just come together. The handle of this
socket is made by fullering down <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1 &times; 3 ins.,
1 in. back from the end, and drawing this out <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in.
round, 2 ins. long. The end is turned over as shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
in the sketch; the other end is filed round to fit the
inside of the socket cylinder. The two pieces are
now brazed together. File the parts that come into
contact with each other perfectly clean, and cover
with borax. Heat it red hot and touch the parts
to be brazed with the end of a piece of brass wire.
At a certain temperature the brass wire will melt
and fill up the spaces between the bottom and the
cylinder. (See <a href="#Page_310">Brazing</a>.) This makes a tight joint:
it is like soldering wrought iron together. This
method of joining is used where welding would be
impossible, as it would be in this case. File the base
off smooth. The candle can now be slipped between
the coils of wire. It should travel in its socket
up and down the spiral. (See drawing.)</p>


<h4>IRON AND STEEL HINGES</h4>

<p>Ornamental hinges are used on doors, wall cabinets,
chests, gates, etc., or wherever suitable.
There are three methods of making hinges: (1)
Solid eye, (2) welded, (3) turned or bent eye. (See
article on Plain Hinges.)</p>

<p><i>Solid eye:</i> The first drawing shows the solid
eye split ornamental hinge.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_416.jpg" width="400" height="309" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Ornamental hinge</div>
</div>

<p><i>Stock:</i> One piece of soft steel or wrought iron,
<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 6 ins. long. Take a bar of iron 18 ins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
long with the above dimensions as to width and
thickness; 5 ins. from the end of the bar fuller down
to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. thick. These 5 ins. are flattened down to
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. thick and 2 ins. wide, any length. Split the
flattened part to within 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins. of the shoulder.
The two ends are now thrown out, tapered, and bent
into shape. Cut the piece from the bar 1 in. back
of the fullered part. Round the piece up, thus
forming the eye. The body of the piece between the
split and the eye is now widened out to 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins.
To do this use the peen of the hammer on the under
side of the metal, thus thinning out the metal in the
centre in order to increase the width. Shape it
up and curve it about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. This, in turn, gives a
nice rounded finished surface similar to the drawer
pull. The chased design on the hinge is made in
the same manner and with the same tools as are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
used in work in chasing. (See chapter on Chasing.)</p>

<p>The butt for the hinge is made of 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. flat
wrought iron. Fuller down the end of the piece,
round it up to fit the diameter of the eye of the hinge.
A hole is punched in the middle of the piece. A
2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. piece of iron is drawn and is pushed
into the hole, riveted down on the short end, and
welded. The other end is drawn out to a square
tapered point. Nick the four edges at intervals
with a sharp chisel, thus throwing up little projections
to prevent it from slipping out of the wood when
driven in to hold the hinge. This kind of hinge
is used mostly for doors. The upper part of the
pin that sticks through the eye of the hinge is ornamented
by a fuller mark and a round top.</p>


<h4>IRON BRACKET</h4>

<p>This bracket is made of three pieces: back piece,
hanger, and support:</p>

<p><i>Stock:</i> Back plate, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1 in. of soft steel or
Norway iron. Hanger and support, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. square.</p>

<p><i>Back plate:</i> The drawing shows the back plate
as a conventional leaf design and is made as follows:
Take the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1 in. of soft steel and shape it according
to the drawing. With the peen of the hammer
widen out the top enough to cut out the design<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
shown here. When cut out as shown, boss up the
centre of the leaves by using the peen hammer on a
round hole. This bossing is a matter of taste.
The lower part is now flattened out, trimmed, and
shaped as shown. The thickness is of no importance.
On the end of the top bar forge a pin about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in.
in diameter to fasten into the back by riveting.</p>

<img src="images/i_418.jpg" width="500" height="380" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Iron bracket</div>
</div>

<p><i>Hook:</i> The hook is made in the same way as
you made the gate hook. The bar is twisted in
the middle.</p>

<p><i>Support:</i> Select a bar the right length and twist
it in the middle. Flatten the ends down and bend
the little curves as shown. This is drilled for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. rivet, then placed in position. Holes are
marked in the hanger and in the back. Rivet the
support in place. Be careful to have the hanger at
right angles to the back. If you do not, the effect
is spoiled, no matter how good the rest of the workmanship
may be.</p>

<h4>WROUGHT IRON LAMP</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> sketch
shows a
wrought
iron lamp with
square base, four
feet, round hollow
post, shade holder
and shade.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_420.jpg" width="400" height="582" alt="Lamp" />
</div>

<p><i>Base:</i> No. 16
soft sheet steel, 10
ins. square.</p>

<p>
Make a 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in.
circle in the centre
of the 10-in.
square piece. Drive
this up <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in.
above the level
by placing it over a 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. hole in a wooden block
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>or a swage block. If this piece of iron is placed
over a hole any diameter and struck on the opposite
side with the peen of the hammer it will sink into
the hole and take the rounding shape. This can
be done while the metal is cold. With a pair of
dividers find the centre of boss and describe a faint
circle 1 in. less than the diameter of the base.
Tangent to those lines draw lines along the edge of
the base. The dotted lines on the sketch show how
the base should be cut out. The stock left on the
corners forms the feet when the sides of the base are
bent into shape. Cut out the piece of metal as
described and bend the sides over <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. The corners
must be heated red hot and formed separately.
This is best done over the heel of the anvil. After
placing the heated corners on the heel of the anvil
drive quickly with a light hammer first on one side
and then on the other, forming and upsetting the
metal into shape at the same time. The flare on
the bottom of the feet is worked in after the corners
and shaped as shown in the sketch. Repeat this
on the four corners. Now flare out the feet on the
horn of the anvil. Out of the centre of the boss
cut a circle a little less than the base of the post,
to receive the post.</p>

<p><i>Post:</i> Take a 10 &times; 5 in. piece and bend it around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
a piece of round iron so that the two edges will fit
close together. The inside and outside of these
are filed for brazing. (See Brazing.) This post
is now bound with good strong wire to keep the
joint close. Cover with flux, place in the fire and
add the smelter to the joint on the inside of the pipe.
When the smelter runs into the joint take it out
of the fire and allow it to cool in the air. The joint
is now filed up on the outside and if properly brazed
should show only a very fine line made by the smelter.
The upper part of the post is now swelled out
as shown in the sketch, by heating at a low heat and
spreading the metal out all around the end.</p>

<p>A cap is placed on top of the post to hold the arms
that support the shade and to hold, too, the electric
light bulb, or gas pipe, or oil well, according to the
light to be used. The cap is made by rounding
the end of a 1-in. bar to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. in diameter, 2 ins.
long. The other end is cut off about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. to allow
for the flattening down to make the cap.</p>

<p>Place the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. stem into a heading tool and flatten
this bar down quite thin. Spread it out so that
the edges can be turned over at right angles to form
a cap to fit the top of the post. This cap can be either
brazed or riveted on to the post. Either will
look well. If used for gas or electric light a hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
should be drilled through the centre of the cap and
through the post to receive the wire. If used for
gas the lower side can be tapered out so that <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in.
gas pipe can be screwed in. Now cut a thread on
the top of the post to fit an electric light socket.
The same thread acts as a holder for the bracket
of the shade holder. Place the cap on the post,
rivet and braze. File the lower part of the post and
the inside of the hole on the base perfectly clean.
The bottom of the post should be filed a little tapering
so it will fit into the base of the hole tight.
Wire it in for brazing so that the post will stand
perpendicular to the base. Carry your binding
wires from the top of the post to the four corners of
the base, using heavy wire for this work of binding.
Cover the joint with flux. Place the centre on the
fire and put the brazing material on the joint around
the post. With a slow heat, heat till the smelter
runs into the joint. Close off the blast, let it remain
in the fire until cold, then remove it.</p>

<p><i>Shade holder:</i> This is made of a piece of 1 &times;
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 10 in. soft steel. Fuller down 3 ins. from the
end to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. Draw this out any length.
Split the other end to within 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> ins. of this fuller
mark. Throw these arms out and draw each
down the same size as the other, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. Place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
the crotch on a small bottom fuller and with the
top fuller spread each arm out so that it will
measure an equal distance from the other arms.
At the same time this will shape the centre.
Drive the end out tapering <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. wide at the base,
tapering to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. square at the ends. The length
of the arms depends upon the size of the shade.
Tip ends of the arms should be bent up <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. to
hold the shade in place. Drill a hole in the centre
of the tripod and tap a thread in the hole to fit the
thread on the end of the cap, so that this will screw
on. These arms can be bent down or up to suit
the height of the shade.</p>

<p><i>Shade:</i> The shade pattern is developed in the
same way as the shade described in the copper article
on lamp shades. In this case, however, each unit
is cut out separately and riveted to the next; all put
together and filed; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. soft iron rivets are used for
riveting the parts.</p>

<p><i>Glass:</i> The glass can be bought at any glazier's.
Cathedral opalescent glass is best. Place a piece
of card-board on one of the units and mark the
outline of the opening. Cut about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. larger than
this outline. This pattern taken to the glazier
can be cut out from any kind of glass, according
to the size wanted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
</p>


<h4>LAMP</h4>

<p>This lamp may be used for gas, oil, or electricity.
The difference between this and the preceding
lamps lies in the construction of the base. The full
page illustration shows lamp described here.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_427.jpg" width="500" height="123" alt="Base" />
</div>

<p><i>Base:</i> Soft steel <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 5 &times; 24 ins.</p>

<p>Mark off the design shown by the full lines
on the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 5 &times; 24 in. piece. This is for one leg
of the lamp. Cut with a sharp cold chisel along the
outline about two thirds of the way through the
thickness. Place the cut line in the jaws of the vise.
With a pair of tongs grasp the waste material, then
with a prying motion break off these pieces. File
up the rough edge left by the cutting. With this
piece as a pattern cut in like manner three more
pieces, making four in all. This makes the stock
for the four legs. Place the foot end of one piece
into the fire and bend about 1 in. of this end into a
small circle having a radius of not more than <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in.
About 5 ins. back from this heat the metal to a
length of 5 ins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
Place it on the anvil as shown and with the hand
hammer drive it into a circle.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_428.jpg" width="300" height="305" alt="Leg" />
</div>

<p>While bending this
into shape keep the
circle a little larger
than the drawing calls
for. The circle is very
easily reduced, while
if it was made too
small in the beginning
one would have to
straighten the whole
piece out to increase the size. Therefore, it is
best to work it large until finished. Wide stock
like this is easily twisted out of shape, so that it is
very difficult to
bend it up in a
circle of this
kind. It is
hard, too, to
change any
twist that may
be worked in.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_428a.jpg" width="400" height="280" alt="Foot" />
</div>

<p>Bend the other three legs in the same way, as
nearly like the first one as you can. Be sure to make
the four legs the same height when finished. Drill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
three holes for <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. bolts, as shown in the sketch.
Seven inches below the top drill one hole in each
leg for a rosette or some form of decorative treatment.
These four legs are held in place by means
of a tapered square plug 4 ins. long. The small end
should fit the smallest width on the lamp legs and
the taper 4 ins. below this width. Drill a hole
through the centre of this plug for a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. gas
pipe, if to be used for gas. The same opening
can be made for electric wires, etc., and a lamp
well, placed at the end for a lamp.</p>

<p><i>To put the lamp together:</i> Place one leg on the
square plug and mark through the holes on the plug.
Centre-punch these holes and drill for a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. top.
The hole should be drilled through the plug. Tap
out the holes and bolt the two legs, one on either
side. While drilling these holes be sure they are
at right angles to the centre axis of the plug. This
means a little blocking up on the tapered end.
Bolt the two legs to the plug by using any short
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. bolts for this purpose. If all work so far has
been carefully done these two legs will stand vertically
to the plane of the table. If not they can be
made to do so by taking out a little of the curve in
the legs, thereby lengthening the side that might
be a little short. Place one leg up on the third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
side and with a scratch awl mark the holes through
on to the plug and drill these three holes through the
plug. Tap out as you did before and put the other
two feet on. Square up all the work done. Bolts
are used for this purpose. Take <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. square bolts,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. long. Reduce the thickness of the head to
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in., flattening and rounding the top slightly.
Put these in place of the temporary bolts. They
will hold the sides of the lamp in place.</p>

<p>A decorative piece can be made out of a bolt
head by placing it in the heading tool and forming
a pyramid shaped head. This is pushed through
the hole and riveted on the other side. Cut off a
piece of gas pipe short enough to extend about 1 in.
above the top of the lamp and to come within 2 ins.
from the base. This is now forced through the hole in
the plug. If any of the bolts should have screwed into
this hole, preventing this pipe from going through,
they should be filed off. To fill up the interval caused
by the four scrolls bending outward on the top of
the lamp, forge a round ball on the end of a square
bar to fit this opening. Cut off the ball and drill
a hole in through the ball to slip over the pipe.
The thread on the end of the pipe should fall below
the top of the ball. Make a tripod as explained in
the description of the preceding lamp. Screw it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
the end of this pipe tight against the ball. The end
of the pipe is used for the fixtures needed.</p>

<h4>LANTERNS</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_431a.jpg" width="300" height="482" alt="Lantern" />
</div>

<p>The lantern shown
here is of a simple design
and can be made
out of material without
putting in any bends or
twists. The material
for the making of the
uprights is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.
steel.</p>

<p>The top and bottom
should be made of No.
16 soft steel. The design
shows that all
pieces are riveted together
on a framework.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>The top can be of one piece and shaped as shown in
the sketch. Bottom is of one piece and is made for
electric light, candle, or oil lamp. Fixtures for any
one of the above ways of lighting must be placed in
the bottom of the lantern. For the candle, a small
socket can be riveted to the bottom. A cup to
receive the oil lamp may be put in place. If candle
or oil is used the bottom of the lantern must be
fastened with a hinge, so that it will open to receive
the lamp or candle. If it is adjusted for using
electric light the cluster sockets can be fastened
to the bottom, or they can hang from the top.
These lanterns can be made in all sizes, from one
small enough for a cozy corner to one large enough
for a lodge keeper's gate.</p>

<p>They may be hung on ornamental brackets, as
shown in the sketch here, or they may hang directly
from the ceiling, with ring or chain fastenings.
They are made square, round, hexagonal, and so forth.</p>


<h4>IRON KETTLE STAND</h4>

<p>The sketch here shows a simple design of a kettle
stand. The parts are (1) upright stand, (2) alcohol
lamp holder, (3) hook.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Material:</i> One piece <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. square iron, 20 ins.
Two pieces <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. square iron, 9 ins. One piece <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
square iron, 7 ins. One piece <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. round iron, 8 ins.
One sheet No. 20 iron, 6 in. in diameter.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Flatten one end of each piece of the
three pieces, <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> &times; 20
in., 2 pieces of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> &times; 9
in. Weld these three
together. Weld the
<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> &times; 7 in. piece to the
three pieces as shown
by the sketch. Bend
the two 9-in. legs out
equal distances from
the front leg. This
forms the tripod.
Bend the ends of the
three short pieces into
a scroll to form the feet.
Now, bend the centre rod up as shown in the sketch.
When this is done catch it in the vise close to the
bend. With the monkey wrench grasp it about
two thirds of the way up and twist the centre
piece to the right a sufficient number of turns to
give it a regular bend between the two points. Reduce
the end of this upright post to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. round and
6 ins. in length, leaving on the end a small boss
about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. This boss is to be rounded up by flattening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
and rounding on the edge of the anvil. Through
the centre of this boss punch a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-in. hole and drive
into it a piece of 8 &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. round
wire. When half of the wire is
pushed through the hole bend
the ends forward and at the same
time drive them into the boss.
This prevents the bent piece of
iron from working up and down.
It is now opened out as shown
by the sketch and bent into a
hook shape. The end of the post
is turned so that the centre of this
hook will hang over the centre of
the tripod.</p>

<p><i>Lamp holder:</i>
Mark on the
6-in. disc a
flower form similar
to the one
shown in the sketch. Cut out the design with
a sharp chisel. File all rough edges and bend
the shape up so that it will fit around the outside
of the alcohol lamp, to hold it in place.
Punch a hole through the centre for a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. rivet
and drill a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. hole directly under the centre of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>the hook. Place the lamp holder on and rivet in
place. When the kettle is placed on the hook it
should hang directly over the lamp. If it does not
do so the post may be changed and the position of
the kettle made to correspond.</p>

<h4>UMBRELLA STAND</h4>

<p>The umbrella stand in the <a href="#PL8">accompanying illustration</a>
shows a splendidly shaped design. You will
notice that the four uprights are curved and twisted,
fastened to two rings 10 ins. in diameter. The pan in
the bottom of the stand, placed there to catch the
drippings from the umbrellas, is made of copper
and is beaten into shape in the same way as you
would drive any pan into form. This is made to fit
in the base of the stand.</p>

<p>To make this stand, take four pieces 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.
flat soft steel, 40 ins. long. Two pieces 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in.,
31 ins. long, are needed for the rings; four pieces
1 &times; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 12 ins. for legs. The copper pan should
be 12 ins. in diameter.</p>

DOOR KNOCKERS, PLATES, ETC.</small></h3>


<h4>DOOR KNOCKER</h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Sketches</span> given here show two different
designs of door knockers. In the first design
the knocker itself is made of round
iron and twisted to form part of the design. It is
made of very heavy stock.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_438.jpg" width="600" height="425" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Door knocker</div>
</div>

<p><i>Stock:</i> Escutcheon plate: 1 &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. flat iron.
Bolt: <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. iron. Knocker: <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 1 &times; 4 ins. long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
<i>Directions:</i> Take the piece of metal intended for
the escutcheon plate and thin the ends out according
to the dimensions of the drawing. Draw out the
end of the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. piece until it is <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. in
diameter and 2 ins. long. The thickness of the door
must determine the length of this bolt. Since the
door knocker fastens on to the door, the bolt
should go through and fasten on the inside with a
washer and nut. The other end of the bolt is
rounded to the dimensions given and a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. hole
is drilled through the centre.</p>

<p><i>Knocker:</i> Taper the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 1 &times; 4 in. piece of iron
down as shown in sketch, retaining the thickness,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in., throughout the whole length. The two small
pins on the end of the knocker are now made <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in.
in diameter and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. long. This whole piece is
bent into shape, the pins touching and the sides filed
parallel to fit the bolt. When it is fastened into
the bolt it should fit up snug and close.</p>

<p><i>Ball for end of knocker:</i> Take a piece of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. round
iron any length. Fuller in as shown by the sketch.
Rivet this to the centre of the knocker, the pin on
the end of the ball projecting far enough through
to make a rather large rivet head on the other side.
The rivet head acts as a knocker. The bolt is
pushed through the escutcheon plate, then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
knocker is ready to be placed on the door. Sometimes
these balls are made long enough to go through
the door and fasten in the same way as the bolt.</p>

<p><i>Second door knocker:</i> The design and dimensions
given here show the general scheme of this knocker.
The escutcheon plate is made with a piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>
&times; 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &times; 7 in. soft steel. The corners of this piece
are clipped off and filed rounding or square.</p>

<p><i>Knocker:</i> The knocker is made in the same way
as the knocker was made in the first design. You
use a piece of very heavy material about 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in.
in diameter. The ends are drawn down to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in.
in diameter. If the stock is 1 in. in diameter,
the piece may be upset large enough in the middle
for the centre. This lessens the work of drawing
out and is perhaps a much quicker way of making
a knocker. The length of the knocker ring before
it is bent is about 15 ins. This is pushed into the
eye bolt. This knocker is placed on the door with
wrought iron nails, one in each corner. The bolts
that hold the knocker are riveted flush to the back
of the plate. This finishing work should be done
by the peen end of the hammer while the metal
is cold.</p>

<p><i>Escutcheon plates:</i> Escutcheon plates are used
for lock plates and fancy key ways. Some are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
plain, while others lend themselves to elaborate
decorations. They are forged out while hot. Two
designs are here given. The simpler
one explains itself.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="i_441"></a><img src="images/i_441.jpg" width="600" height="365" alt="Knockers and plates" />
</div>

<p><i>Decorated Plate:</i></p>

<p><i>Stock:</i> <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 1 &times; 6 in. soft steel.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Mark off 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. each way from the
centre of the plate and centre-punch. This allows
about 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. on each end for drawing-out purposes.
Draw ends out. (See <a href="#i_441">sketch</a>). Split the metal
down to the centre-punch mark as shown in the
sketch. These small ends are now bent out, and
the long ends are bent in a circle, thus forming the
design. The key way is made by drilling two <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in.
holes <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. apart about the middle of the piece.
Chisel out a piece between the two holes according
to the design. Drill four holes as shown. These
are for screws or wrought iron nails, used to fasten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
plates to doors. Many escutcheon plates are used
for wall cabinets, cedar chests, doors, etc.</p>


<h4>DOOR KNOCKERS</h4>

<p><i>Stock:</i> Piece of soft steel <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. thick, 3 &times; 7
ins., for the escutcheon. Knocker, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
ins. Eye bolt <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> bar
any length. Strike pin, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>
in. round, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. long (on
bar).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="i_442"></a><img src="images/i_442.jpg" width="300" height="348" alt="Door knocker" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> Mark off on
a thin sheet of metal the
outline of the drawing.
Cut the escutcheon plate
same shape as the drawing
(using cold chisel). File it
up so that the edges are perfectly smooth. With
a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. drill, drill holes for the screws.</p>

<p><i>Knocker:</i> Split the 5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. piece of stock, leaving
1 in. square for the eye bolt and eye untouched.
Round up the wings to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter. Twist
the two wings according to the design. Bring the
two loose ends together and weld up 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. from the
end. The same heat will enable you to draw and
shape the loop. Spread out the parts between the
weld and the twist, forming in this way the loop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
<i>Eye bolt:</i> This is best made by working the end
of a bar any length of the size stock given. The
drawing shows a jaw-shaped holder to receive the
eye of the knocker.</p>

<p>Punch a hole about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. from the end of
the bar about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter. Cut out the
piece between the hole and the end of the bar
with a chisel. This forms the jaw. The small
pin end is fullered down and drawn out the same
as you did on the boss of the ring for the andiron,
then it is riveted on to the escutcheon plate
(see <a href="#i_442">drawing</a>) in place to receive the knocker.
A <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-in. hole is drilled through this and through
the eye of the knocker for the rivet to fasten
the two together. The strike pin is made in the
same way as the eye bolt, except that there is no
jaw, just the plain piece of iron. The sketch
shows a simple projection for the knocker to
strike on.</p>

<p>Door knockers were used formerly in place of
door bells, but to-day they are merely used for
ornamental purposes.</p>


<h4>DOOR PULLS</h4>

<p>Door pulls are used as knockers, too. In general
they take the place of door knobs, and are used in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
conjunction with a door plate. They are made of
soft steel or iron.</p>

<p><i>Stock:</i> Soft steel or wrought
iron, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &times; 3 &times; 6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins., made
same way as the door knockers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_444.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="Door knockers" />
</div>


<h4>DOOR HANDLES</h4>

<p><i>Stock:</i> <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. round, 6 ins. long, of soft steel or
wrought iron.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_444b.jpg" width="400" height="245" alt="Door handle" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions:</i> The piece of stock is drawn from the
centre 2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. both ways to <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. in diameter.
This will leave a
piece of the full
size material on
each end of the
rod. Flatten this
out from the wide
ends. Heat the
iron very hot and flatten it down so that the width
will be not less than 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. to 2 ins., to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. thick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
Cut the design out. Any one of the designs shown
can be used. The bosses are drawn up from the
under part by using
the peen of the
hammer and driving
it into a hard
wood block, or on
an iron stake, as
explained in the
article on embossing. A very blunt chisel, like a
fuller, will give the centre effect. The handles are
now bent into shape. Some handles are twisted
out of flat stock.</p>

<h4>DRAWER PULLS</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_445a.jpg" width="600" height="283" alt="Drawer pulls" />
<div class="caption"></div>
</div>

<p>Drawer pulls are made in much the same way as
door knockers. There are the escutcheon plate,
bolt, and ring. They may be made to push through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
a drawer of any kind. The design depends much
upon the use the drawer pull is put to. They can
be made out of round iron, flat iron, twisted iron.</p>

<p><i>Stock:</i> Escutcheon plate, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. soft steel, 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins.
round. Bolt, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. square on the bar. Ring,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &times; 6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ins., all of soft steel.</p>

<p><i>Directions:</i> With a cold chisel cut a piece of flat
soft steel 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ins. round and make a disc. Divide
the disc as shown by the drawing. File out the
escalloped edges and with a small hand chisel chase
the lines so as to form the design. The small half-round
chisel will form the ovals and a centre-punch
will form the dots. The ring is made by drawing
each end of the 6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. piece to a taper, leaving
about one third of it for a centre. The ends should
be tapered to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. round. These ends fit into the
bolt. Bend the ring into a circle. Engrave
the design as you did on the escutcheon plate,
using the same tools. The eye bolt is made
from the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-in. square bar by drawing out the
end of the bar 2 ins. or less in length, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> round,
the length depending upon the thickness of the
drawer. This bolt is to go through the drawer
and be screwed tight in place with a nut. The
large part is now cut off <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. in length and the four
corners knocked down. A <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-in. hole should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
drilled through the bolt to receive the ring. Heat
the ring red hot at the heavy part and with a pair
of tongs open it out just wide enough to receive
the eye bolt. Then the ring is pushed into place.</p>

<p><i>Bossing up:</i> Place the disc while cold on the
hollow wood block and drive down from the under
side with the hammer, bending in the inside. This
makes the outside slightly oval, so that the bearing
will be on the outer surface. The depth of this
concave should not exceed <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. A few designs
are here given.</p>
